All I crave is for someone to genuinely like me, anyone at all. I'm never the first or even second choice for anyone, it's as if no one ever considers me. The world feels like a lonely place, especially with college looming ahead where I'll be surrounded by strangers. The thought is utterly daunting.

It seems like everyone around here is working against me, and that's the reason for my current situation. People can be so awful. All I crave is some happiness and love. That's all I need right now. Before I hit 22, I'm considering ending my life. It might sound silly, but at least by doing that, I can reassure my deceased self that I didn't have to endure more failure. I avoided becoming that 30-year-old who couldn't drive or find love, who grew old without a father or a first kiss, who still gets picked on at 40, or became the 50-year-old virgin with no house at 60 and no grandchildren at 70. There seems to be no escape from these dark thoughts during another night filled with overwhelming anxiety and depression. Medications haven't put an end to this vicious cycle; maybe I should explore more options to combat my mental health struggles. Earlier today, as I went for a walk, I saw two girls I found attractive but couldn't muster the courage to speak to them – now I'm drowning in self-hatred and negative thoughts and feel like crying. Excuse me for being too sensitive; being myself never seems to be good enough - people seem to prefer me struggling rather than succeeding. What is the point of this existence? Successful people can go screw themselves; disconnecting from social media only leads to an influx of notifications – it's evident they wouldn't even notice if I ceased to exist. My depression and rage are spiraling out of control while anxiety lingers in the background daily, driving me to the brink of insanity each passing moment. The intensity of my depression and anxiety is only escalating; even on days when things seem okay, by nightfall like tonight, all sense of joy evades me, leaving me baffled by life's happenings both around me and within me. The weight of stress has ceased being amusing; it's suffocating beyond belief.''\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

My mind is filled with conflicting emotions - part of me wants to go through with my plans, but another part hesitates.

My career endeavors ended in disappointment, marked by a series of failures that have left me feeling deeply unsettled and embarrassed. Downsizing to the point of selling off my cherished books and possessing only a scant wardrobe devoid of professionalism or elegance has added to my sense of despair.\n\nEach passing day feels devoid of purpose as I struggle with insomnia plagued by relentless nightmares. Despite what my family believes, I have come to understand that it's not a mental disorder but rather years of accumulated trauma that weigh heavily on me. Financial instability looms over me, residing in a house provided by my boyfriend's mother with an uncertain future ahead and strained relationships.\n\nThe weight of past decisions, including a traumatic abortion experience, continues to cast a shadow over any semblance of joy or love in my life. The physical toll is evident as I witness the deterioration of my appearance and social withdrawal leading to isolation and emotional stagnation. The bleak prospect of potential homelessness coupled with thoughts of an inevitable decline due to years of smoking further fuels my despondency.\n\nDespite observing others with seemingly more resources choosing to end their lives, I find myself stuck in this cycle of agony without respite. The ceaseless agony makes every moment feel like an eternity as I grapple with feelings of worthlessness and resentment towards those closest to me. The desire for a swift escape through means like having access to a gun intensifies while contemplating drastic actions such as jumping from a tall bridge only adds to the grim outlook on possibilities awaiting beyond.\n\nExpressions laden with bitter cynicism reflect on the regrets accumulated from past choices, leading to self-deprecation and feelings of insignificance.

{"prompt":"A brief saga of my life. Hi everyone,. I have been grappling with depression for an extensive period, dating back to my early school years and it has only escalated since then. I am currently 19 and things are incredibly bleak for me. Both my mom and dad have passed away (mom around 4 years ago and dad around 5), I endured mental and physical abuse from my mother (though I hold no animosity towards her). Despite acknowledging that her actions were unjustifiable, I understand she was battling numerous mental health issues. My father was absent from my life since I was around 11-12, and my mom's demise was due to sleep apnea and heart complications, while my father passed away in a car accident. They were estranged from each other, and I deeply miss them both. \nMoving forward... My initial suicide attempt involved using a phone charger when I couldn't locate any rope, feeling utterly hopeless. After that incident, I made a \"promise\" to myself that I would enlist in the military and meet my end in combat, but this mindset shifted once I moved in with my aunt and uncle. Things seemed to be looking up—I was excelling academically and even though self-loathing persisted, everything appeared to be on the upturn. Friends and family commended me for being resilient, assuring me of their unwavering support no matter what. However, it dawned on me that all my achievements were merely a product of relying on the care and backing of others. My high school graduation and college acceptance were solely propelled by their relentless efforts; however, as soon as college began, everything spiraled out of control faster than one could say \"Oui.\" My academic performance plummeted, signaling an end to relying on others.\nMy motivation dwindled, putting my job at risk. Despite numerous brushes with mortality, the thought of the anguish it would inflict upon my family always held me back. Each day becomes more arduous, especially after a recent arrest for possessing mushrooms (a felony where I reside), resulting in two nights behind bars—now the only way to mitigate further damage is by getting back on track academically which seems insurmountable given the classes missed and backlog of assignments.\nI refrain from discussing my emotions openly; each time someone inquires about my well-being or state of mind, I fabricate a response. It is mentally draining and increasingly tempting to view death as the ultimate solution to mend familial bonds when all I seem to cause are disruptions that push everyone away.\n\nSince relocating onto campus, it appears that things have improved within my aunt and uncle's household now that I am absent. Lately, I've begun contemplating ways to end my life so it appears accidental; however, options seem limited aside from hotline suggestions. Expressing these thoughts to a stranger over the phone induces anxiety in me; hence why venting online feels more comfortable.\n\nThank you for listening to what feels like a lengthier TED talk from me; apologies for any lapses in grammar or punctuation throughout this narrative\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}

Looking back at my childhood reveals a non-traditional upbringing marked by selective mutism and a tendency to retreat into my own thoughts. School was challenging as I struggled with being seen and understood in a system that didn't cater to my needs for autonomy in learning. My family's conservative views left me feeling invisible next to my extroverted sister and overshadowed by the care required for my youngest sister's rare condition. This sense of neglect was magnified by traumatic experiences that were not met with the necessary support or intervention from those around me. The absence of my supportive grandfather and the trauma of his death only deepened my feelings of abandonment and fear of losing those close to me.\n\nThe rejection of studying engineering on scholarship abroad due to outdated beliefs further crushed my spirit, leading me down a path of addiction as a means of coping with the overwhelming darkness inside me. As this cycle continues, I face physical repercussions from this destructive coping mechanism, further reinforcing feelings of failure and unworthiness.\n\nI am left feeling like a shadow of myself, devoid of dreams or hope for the future.

They harbor a belief that they hold no value to anyone and are not deserving of time or effort from others. Thus, they have resigned themselves to lie in silence until gathering the courage and willpower to take action. Reflecting on how they had once experienced a period of success only to squander it, the writer acknowledges the dangers of relying heavily on others as they have done. Their once bright prospects for the future now appear bleak due to their own missteps that have led to strained relationships. \n\nAcknowledging their pattern of self-sabotage driven by issues like depression, anxiety, self-loathing, and low self-esteem only reinforces their belief that they are at fault for their current predicament.

They feel tethered to existence solely by their concern for sparing their younger siblings from pain. Enveloped in a haze of hopelessness devoid of purpose or direction, the writer yearns for an existence characterized by suffering in all forms without preference.\n\nThe author's plan manifests as committing thoughts to paper until the last day of December comes around - after which they intend to end their life at the onset of the new year due to an overpowering sense of fatigue and despair.

At the age of 23, my experiences with relationships have been disheartening. I seem to have never been viewed by women as a potential partner or even as a man. I constantly fell short in their eyes, lacking that elusive quality they sought. This feeling of inadequacy has become unbearable. The current societal standards, influenced by a mix of social expectations and the prevalence of dating apps like Tinder, have intensified the challenges for men who are perceived as below average to find fulfillment. It pains me to admit that resentment towards women has grown within me due to consistent rejection and being relegated to the friend zone.\n\nAt this moment, my frustration has reached its peak, driving me to numb myself with alcohol. I find it hard to carry on living under these circumstances. Encounters with women only bring about rejection or the offer of friendship, which feels like mockery.

{"prompt":"I despise feeling unattractive. The way people treat me, with condescension and cruelty, expecting me to conform to their standards and belittling my flaws without any tangible impact on them, is unbearable. The continuous dismissal and harsh critique have led me to a point where I'm overwhelmed with anger and thoughts of ending my life. The realization of the dehumanization I've faced since my childhood has been particularly painful. While hiding behind a mask, where my eyes are praised for their beauty and my nose is admired, I receive kindness and empathy from others; it's a stark contrast to the substandard treatment I endure when unmasked. Regrettably, the financial constraints make seeking plastic surgery an unattainable solution. My history is marred with abuse, from a troubled family environment to enduring relentless bullying in school, perpetuating my sense of worthlessness. This mistreatment has contributed significantly to my social awkwardness over the years, resulting in consistent disregard from both men and women. My life is filled with nothing but loathing.

{"prompt":"I'm a 21-year-old man feeling like I'll never truly experience love. My mental and emotional instability, coupled with feelings of being strange and unattractive, make me believe that I am not capable of being loved. All I yearn for is to find a woman to love and share my life with, but my self-perception as a failure convinces me that I am destined to live a solitary existence. It's a challenge for me to communicate my need for help to my parents, particularly considering that I typically keep my emotions guarded. Despite being diagnosed with moderate depression and anxiety and making efforts to abstain from drinking which seemed to worsen my condition, I am now in a state where getting out of bed feels like an insurmountable task, and thoughts of ending my life linger in my mind.\n\nWith the loss of all my friends, I feel that turning to therapy and medication may provide some hope, even though financial constraints make it necessary for me to seek support from my parents. The thought of initiating this conversation is daunting given our communication barriers. I struggle with self-sabotage, constantly attempting self-improvement only to fall short time after time, reinforcing the belief that solitude and death are the only inevitable outcomes in store for me.\n\nValentine's Day is an annual reminder of my isolation and romantic failures. The absence of past relationships weighs heavily on me as does the recent rift with friends due to what I perceive as toxic behavior on my part. As the evening approaches, seeking solace in alcohol seems like the only option before considering more permanent measures. \n\nMy preoccupation with sexualizing women has heightened interpersonal anxieties, making it difficult for me to form meaningful connections. This pattern of objectification causes distress, leading me down a path of avoidance and fear when interacting with women both in reality and media representations.\n\nValentine's Day has evolved into a day filled with self-loathing and bitterness towards the concept of love as others celebrate their relationships while I remain solitary. The temptation to numb these feelings with alcohol grows stronger as sleep offers an escape from the perpetual loneliness that haunts me.\n\nAt 21 years old, Valentine's Day acts as a harsh reminder of my perceived inadequacies and failures in matters of the heart. Observing loved ones surround themselves with companionship while I face each day alone intensifies feelings of worthlessness, pushing me closer towards contemplating an end to this existence characterized by solitude and despair.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

I suspect my aunt caught sight of the scars on my leg from half a year ago because they stubbornly refuse to fade. Isn't it ironic? I wonder if taking SN would be even more excruciating with a messed up esophagus. If only I could afford nitrogen gas. It seems that no one truly acknowledges the depth of your pain as long as you remain alive. People seem so eager to extend others' agony by insisting they endure unbearable circumstances. For what reason? And it's not always true that things will eventually improve. The self-loathing is overwhelming. I had intended to end it all yesterday but, incredibly, sheer laziness and procrastination got in the way, and now here I am today facing the same issue once again. Why can't I just go through with it? Regret haunts me daily for not taking action, so why does my foolish mind thwart every attempt? Today is Mother's Day, a fitting occasion for me to disappear into the depths. Although I had contemplated it yesterday, procrastination got the better of me. Perhaps today would offer an even more suitable opportunity to depart this world. Any recommendations for painless, straightforward methods have been redacted—figures. So what if I was already contemplating an attempt due to my wretched, abusive family and now my friend has essentially dismissed my struggles and blatantly shown they couldn't care less if I were to end it all before blocking me. It seems like the time has come for me to bid farewell. I'm considering resorting to drowning in a shallow water blackout in my bathtub—farewell indeed. The weight of it all is becoming unbearable; why have there been eight futile attempts at freeing myself from this torment? Why do even suicide attempts end in failure for me? It's utterly unjust—I just want release from this existence. The cruelty reaches its peak when everyone views my abusive and repulsive mother as some sort of saint despite her endangering our lives; she's driving me past breaking point with no respite in sight anymore... Why won't any of my suicide endeavors come to fruition and liberate me from this madness already? Is the universe conspiring against me just so that I'm pushed to such extremes that harming her becomes inevitable... releasing her at last from the hell she inflicts upon us all? Let me depart this torment; why am I continuously confronted with defeat after defeat, as though the cosmos dictates that suffering must be prolonged indefinitely? Enough is enough — can't I just be granted peace by departing this realm? Life feels utterly devoid of meaning, leaving a deep weariness within me... There should genuinely be an option for euthanasia available for those who are exhausted by life's relentless challenges such as myself... And by the way, thanks to the lousy new Reddit update, typing has become an ordeal due to its extreme lag — each update manages to worsen things further without fail... Why does oxy have such a negative impact on how I feel? Both times when I experimented with oxycodone two years back left me overwhelmingly dizzy and overall feeling terrible instead of providing any relief—shouldn't it bring about feelings of solace instead according to common beliefs about its effects? Just so you know, those instances represent my sole encounters with opiates.'\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}

The financial strain is so severe that affording medications or therapy seems like an impossible feat.

I am consumed by the belief that something is fundamentally flawed about me and fear that I will remain isolated for the remainder of my existence. What intensifies this despair is the expectation that I should not be feeling this way, as everything outwardly appears to be going well. Despite having a supportive family, a job, and financial stability, I am plagued by self-blame for my desire to end my life. My tumultuous relationship with my body stems from a longstanding struggle with weight issues, which despite efforts to address, continues to fuel my self-disgust. The added layer of being a transgender man further exacerbates these feelings, as despite transitioning with testosterone for two years, the world still perceives me as female due to my reluctance to correct others. The combination of weight insecurities and gender dysphoria amplifies my self-hatred. Compounding these challenges is my sexual orientation - being attracted to men while also harboring uncertainty about being asexual. The rejection experienced in my past relationship with another trans man reinforces my perception of inadequacy and doubt that I will ever measure up. The intersectionality of not conforming to societal norms, coupled with lacking desire for sexual intimacy, creates a sense of unworthiness in the realm of romance. Though I do not have intentions of ending my life, I can't shake the belief that those around me would fare better without having to endure my struggles - whether it be listening to my complaints as friends or navigating the complexities of raising a transgender child as family.

The online learning environment is something I deeply loathe. My parents are already greatly disheartened by my perceived weaknesses and lack of engagement; if this situation escalates, it may be the tipping point leading to harsh admonishments and hurtful labels such as laziness. I am doing everything within my power to prevent being dropped from the class, but falling a week behind schedule coupled with having already withdrawn from another course due to stress is taking its toll on me. It's frustrating that my emotional numbness and lack of motivation are hindering my proactive approach towards resolving these issues. I feel detached from myself, struggling to formulate thoughts or decisions independently without external input. I long for a straightforward diagnosis from a medical professional to shed light on the turmoil within me, as articulating it myself feels impossible. Whatever is afflicting me feels significantly severe. Despite my efforts, I fear that by the time I reach 21, regardless of my wishes, ending it all might seem like the only option left. The act of reaching out or writing this feels almost aimless; perhaps seeking solace or understanding in some way. This perpetual sense of immaturity and helplessness is suffocating me inside out. The exhaustion and teary eyes only intensify these overwhelming emotions; finding relief through tears has become routine. Can anyone else relate to feeling mentally foggy and incapable of coherent thinking? It's a struggle even pinpointing what exactly feels wrong within me under layers of deep-seated depression and introversion, embodying the stereotypical image of a reserved individual. Night after night, tears stream down while an ache occupies my gut and chest, leaving me emotionally drained at bedtime. It seems like basic desires elude me or have always been overshadowed by passivity and indifference throughout my life—a cycle that seems unbreakable now.\nThe mounting academic backlog fuels self-doubt further; dropping out isn't an option as it would lead to further disappointment from my parents and derail any semblance of stability in my life.

My nerves are constantly frayed, and I sense an impending outburst at even the slightest inconvenience regardless of the circumstances. I fear that my uncontrollable rage may eventually lead me to causing serious harm to someone, resulting in potential incarceration. At this point, it seems like my only options are either walking into an emergency room and confessing my suicidal intentions to secure admission to a psychiatric unit or following through with ending my life. The decision still hangs in the balance as I weigh my choices without having stepped foot outside yet. Yet, it appears that secluding myself for life would be most beneficial for society.

The challenges of living with epilepsy, constant headaches, paranoia, overthinking, sleep disturbances, body dysmorphia, anorexia, a melancholic mind, recklessness, brain fog, and the inability to focus on daily tasks have made life unbearable. These struggles trace back to my childhood where I grappled with selective mutism and found solace in my internal world filled with inner monologues and a vivid imagination. Unlike other kids who played outdoors, I immersed myself in reading my grandfather's books. School was a place where I felt like an outsider and struggled to fit into the conventional learning environment that did not resonate with me.\n\nAt home, I felt neglected within my conservative family dynamic. My elder extroverted sister unintentionally overshadowed me, while my youngest sister's rare medical condition demanded most of my parents' attention, leaving me feeling invisible and lacking guidance. This early sense of isolation planted seeds of loneliness that grew as I aged. Mute for almost 15 years, I found comfort in silence but also endured emotional turmoil. Traumatic experiences like a car accident left untreated by my father and physical harm inflicted by a teacher went unaddressed by my parents. Enduring bullying without support took a toll on both my mental and physical health.\n\nThe absence of strong parental support and coping with traumatic events led me to develop epilepsy and experience debilitating flashbacks and breakdowns requiring hospitalization. Amidst this turmoil, the only source of solace was my late grandfather whose passing added another layer of abandonment trauma. The fear of losing those close to me fueled a deep-seated fear of abandonment leading me to build walls around myself for protection.\n\nDreams shattered as opportunities like a scholarship to study engineering in Malaysia were vetoed by my father due to outdated beliefs about girls living independently. This rejection plunged me into depression characterized by self-destructive behavior including abusing painkillers and antidepressants leading to addiction and severe physical health deterioration.\n\nFacing setbacks in relationships and academic pursuits intensified feelings of failure and unworthiness exacerbating self-sabotaging tendencies.

Solitude usually brings me peace, but being alone in a crowd only amplifies the negativity swirling in my mind. The prospect of seeking help seems distant as I'm just a high school senior with limited options at hand. Attempts to involve the school only made matters worse, and my mom doesn't see the need for therapy unless she can control the narrative - which isn't how therapy works. Financial constraints prevent me from pursuing help independently as well. Living with a mother and her partner who belittle everything about me adds an extra layer of distress; mentioning my friends to them risks driving away those precious relationships through lies and manipulation. Although I acknowledge my imperfections and past mistakes, it feels unfair to continuously push away those who genuinely care for me - especially my two dear friends. The future looks bleak as I struggle to find reasons to continue living; however strong love for my two friends prevents me from taking any drastic actions even though I'm at a loss for solutions. Enduring another year knowing something within me needs fixing is an immense burden that weighs heavily on me daily; never did I anticipate things would deteriorate to this extent. Setting a grim ultimatum for myself - that if things don't improve by graduation night then it might be time to end it all – reveals the depth of desperation clouding my thoughts lately. Even if that day comes around, attending graduation feels pointless as there's no connection or desire from anyone involved for me to be there either – inside or out––honestly speaking – slipping away from life altogether seems increasingly tempting.\"Things are just getting harder.\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}
{"prompt":"I am feeling lost and overwhelmed. Hi there. I am struggling to find a way forward. The constant suicidal thoughts are consuming me. My friends are distancing themselves from me because of my depression. I attempt to confide in them, but they doubt the severity of my struggles since I don't bear visible scars on my arms, only on my knees. My faith in everything is dwindling rapidly. It's 3:07 am, and I'm grappling with thoughts of taking my own life.\n\nI have made two suicide attempts in just three weeks, halting inexplicably each time. Initially, I had contemplated overdosing, but now I am contemplating jumping from a nearby 200-foot bridge accessible by an hour's bike ride from my home - no big deal.\n\nI feel like a burden, bringing everyone down with me. I face persistent bullying primarily due to my ADHD and severe anxiety, which leave me mute or reserved around others unless they are part of my inner circle. The tormentors continuously urge me to end my life, asserting that my prior attempts should have succeeded because of my perceived lack of intelligence.\n\nFor the past four years, I have concealed my emotions, letting them accumulate until the point where the only solution seems to be ending it all - hopefully soon so as not to endure this emotional weight any longer. My abusive father, whom I fled from four years ago as an eight-year-old due to his narcissistic tendencies and penchant for control through physical and psychological abuse has left indelible scars on me.\n\nBefore anyone points it out (if at all), yes, I am aware that at 15, there should be a life awaiting me ahead. Regrettably, I cannot envision that future either physically or mentally. Despite previously having a therapist, reaching out for help is currently not an option for me as I am set on ending my existence – thereby ruling out contacting any school counselor.\n\nAll I desire is to end it all; that's the stark reality. Remaining here feels unbearable. While my mother loves me dearly and represents the sole remaining pillar of support in addition to some relatives whom I barely communicate with anymore due to the UK lockdown triggering a deepening sense of desolation within me.\n\nMy ADHD combined with anxiety and PTSD make me an easy target for bullies who taunt me about being 'edgy' and make callous jokes about previous suicide attempts – further reinforcing their belief that embracing that darkness is beyond deserving on this earth than they perceive themselves to be better suited for it over me.\n\nI shall attempt to get some rest now.

{"prompt":"I'm feeling utterly exhausted by everything. Lately, life has been an immense struggle. These days, the only solace I find is in thoughts of ending my life. My battle with severe depression has been relentless, a lifelong companion. Each day, the weight of my past decisions and mistakes leaves me feeling like a despicable human being. My emotional instability and anxiety have caused irreparable damage to nearly all my relationships or any potential ones. The shame I experience when reflecting on my past actions is overwhelming. Over the past year, I've watched as numerous friendships slipped through my fingers, and now that I've graduated from college, maintaining connections has become even more challenging. Unemployment has left me stagnant at home, compounding my isolation due to the shame and depression that weigh on me constantly from the reasons mentioned above.\n\nEach day feels like a lonely battle for survival, as I struggle to find a reason to keep going. My family is worried, particularly my mom, but most of the time all I can manage is secluding myself in my room. My appetite has vanished, my sleep schedule is chaotic, and it's been weeks since I last set foot in the gym. Simply getting out of bed feels like an insurmountable feat.\n\nAs a Black trans man, I am fortunate to have a therapist who not only understands but shares my background; however, I question whether there's any help out there that could truly make a difference for me. While I confide in her about many issues, disclosing my suicidal thoughts remains too shameful for me. The fear that her professional obligations might lead to legal intervention prevents me from being fully honest about this aspect of my struggles – having law enforcement show up at my door would only worsen an already unbearable situation.\n\nMost days, the desire to no longer exist grows stronger within me. Life's relentless pain leaves me questioning if anything is truly worth it. Though I attempt to envision a future where self-love and forgiveness are possible, it often feels like an unattainable dream. The pervasive belief that I am burdensome leads me to believe that perhaps both people and the world would be better off without me there at all.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

Many times, I find myself convinced that perhaps I don't belong in this world.

My parents are already highly disappointed in me for coming across as weak, lethargic, and withdrawn, and this latest setback might just push them over the edge. Falling behind by a week and having already dropped a class due to stress isn't helping matters. Dealing with anhedonia and apathy is making me worry about being dropped even more, and it's hindering my ability to react to the situation proactively. I feel like I've lost touch with myself. My mind feels blank, unable to come up with thoughts or decisions unless prompted by someone else. I yearn for a clear diagnosis from a professional who can identify what's going on with me because articulating my struggles seems impossible.\n\nThe sense of something deeply amiss within me is unsettling. The thought of reaching 21 and contemplating ending everything involuntarily looms heavily over me.

The fear that any chance at improvement or love will come too late gnaws at me daily – feeling like I'm missing out on opportunities slipping through my fingers.\n\nThe fear that only death will make others aware of your struggles is suffocating.

{"prompt":"It's always the insignificant issues that seem to be the tipping point for me, driving me to extreme despair and thoughts of ending it all. I know it might sound trivial to others, but what set me off was my parents deciding to confine the kittens in their room at night instead of letting them sleep on my bed. Due to COVID restrictions, I had taken care of their new kittens alone for a few weeks before visiting them (within our support bubble). Naturally, after being solely responsible for them for almost three weeks, the kittens have grown quite attached to me. I had planned a week-long visit, even booking time off work, expecting that my parents would want to spend time together with me despite the presence of the kittens.\n\nHowever, they show no interest in bonding with the kittens and instead feel resentful when the kittens seek out my company. Seeing them locked in my parents' room without access to essentials like water or a litter tray has left me feeling infuriated. Is it unreasonable for me to be upset about this situation? Why does this seemingly trivial issue drive me to tears in the garage at 3am, torn between feeling guilty for simply helping out and fighting against the urge to simply wander off into oblivion because right now, I couldn't care less about what happens to me? Part of me wishes something dire would happen just so these overwhelming thoughts would cease.\n\nMy relationship with my parents has always been strained - marked by emotional and spiritual abuse since my teenage years, if not earlier. The realization that being here only amplifies my desire to vanish makes it all the more unbearable. With no one else to turn to, I feel entirely defeated.

While there are underlying issues contributing to this breaking point, it baffles me that this minor incident is what has pushed me overboard. It seems illogical and foolish.\n\nI've spent hours trying to dissect every facet of my current struggles but I find no solutions or exits.

Simple tasks like going for a run seem distant even though the solution is within reach. Imaginary friends occupy my thoughts – particularly a girl I once glimpsed, beautifully envisioned with a complex persona as if we share a profound connection.

{"prompt":"A turbulent journey. Greetings, everyone. I've been grappling with depression for an extended period, starting as far back as second grade and escalating since then. I'm currently 19, and my life is in complete disarray. Both my mother (almost four years ago) and father (nearing five years) have passed away. I endured mental and physical abuse from my mother – though I harbor no bitterness towards her, recognizing her own battles with various mental health issues. My father was estranged from my life around the age of 11-12; he met his end in a car accident while my mother succumbed to sleep apnea and an enlarged heart. Despite their separation, I deeply miss them both. \nOn a separate note, the first time I tried to end my life involved a phone charger when rope wasn't available – feeling utterly hopeless. Following that attempt, I made a promise to myself to enlist in the military and meet my end in combat, but this changed upon moving in with my aunt and uncle. Initially, things seemed to improve: I excelled academically and despite still grappling with self-loathing, everything appeared on an upward trajectory. Friends and family lauded me as exceptionally resilient, assuring unwavering support under any circumstances.\nHowever, it dawned on me that all achievements were merely a result of leaning on the love and assistance of others. My high school graduation and entry into college were solely due to their relentless push; yet once college commenced, everything spiraled downwards rapidly. My academic performance plummeted, marking the end of my reliance on others' support. My motivation waned, jeopardizing my job security.\nDespite various suicide attempts, the thought of inflicting pain upon my family halts me every time. Each day grows more arduous; recently, a brush with the law involving possession of shrooms resulted in a two-night stint in jail – a felony offense where I reside – now contingent on improving my grades to prevent further deterioration; seemingly unattainable given the mounting classwork neglected thus far.\nI refrain from discussing emotions openly; each inquiry regarding my well-being is met with falsehoods. The mental strain is overwhelming; death increasingly appears as the only solution to unify my fractured family – perceiving myself as nothing but a source of trouble that alienated those closest to me.\nUpon moving onto campus, it seems things have improved within my aunt and uncle's household following my departure. Lately, thoughts have gravitated towards researching methods for ending my life whilst camouflaging it as an accident although options seem limited beyond helplines.\nSharing these sentiments over the phone induces anxiety; hence venting online feels more appropriate to me.

{"prompt":"After confiding in my family, I now find myself in a state of profound discomfort. Due to my declining mental health, I have made the difficult decision to move back in with my parents. Having disclosed nearly everything about my struggles to them was excruciatingly embarrassing, leaving me feeling mortified and wanting to escape the situation. While living with my family is not something I relish, it seemed like the only option aside from contemplating suicide. The knowledge of what I shared with them now makes me feel physically ill.\n\nThere was a moment where suicide seemed imminent, but in a desperate plea for help, I poured out all my feelings to my mother through a text message. As a result, I am now withdrawing from college and preparing for the move back home. The thought of residing with my family again fills me with dread as it is an environment I struggle to cope in. The decision weighs heavily on me, and I fear that it may be one filled with regret. The ease of death feels like an appealing option.\n\nOpening up to my family has only heightened my discomfort as they are now privy to the extent of my struggles. In moments of weakness, thoughts of overdosing crossed my mind tonight, even though deep down, I knew it wouldn't be fatal. My existence has become unbearable. Neglecting college attendance and failing every course has left me in a precarious situation.\n\nI am drowning under the weight of unmet obligations and responsibilities; getting out of bed itself feels like an insurmountable task. Stranded in this dark place, I am at a loss for what steps to take next or where to seek solace. Feeling trapped between life and death is torturous; the will to end it all conflicts with an inability to carry out such actions.\n\nAlthough admitting myself into inpatient care briefly crossed my mind as a cry for help, the mere thought of how my parents would react fills me with discomfort. Enduring silent suffering has been a long-standing pattern for me; however, it seems like reaching out now is imperative.\n\nDecisions loom before me – should I inform my parents about dropping out temporarily? Will focusing on recovery suffice? But then again, there's the fear that they might dismiss it as mere depression linked to joblessness rather than seeing it as profound mental distress.\n\nThe notion of consuming more pills just enough to warrant hospitalization flits through my mind today despite knowing it won't end fatally – such is the desperation for help cropping up within me.\n\nThis facade of coping well can no longer be sustained – the truth about how severe things have become needs acknowledgment by those around me. The indifference towards recovery itself further complicates matters; however bleak the situation appears.\n\nAmidst this chaos lies an intense need for assistance - substantial help that goes beyond merely getting by pretending everything is fine when inside everything is falling apart unknowingly to others around me who remain blissfully unaware at present.\n\nAs irrational as it may seem craving an overdose as a plea for aid has become a possible avenue worth exploring despite reservations lingering within - illustrating just how dire this situation has grown lately into unrestricted despair without clear guidance on what step’s next could look like moving forward given current circumstances encountered along life’s journey towards healing from within oneself under cover darkness lurking beneath surfaces hoping finding path illuminated following hearts calling beyond realms known preceding times life-altering transformation shifted perspective beyond scope initial understanding making way forward journey Earth unfold ending crucial moment shining beacon light showing pathway salvation amidst storm turbulent seas uncertainty call forth spirit warrior guiding hand steadying heart midst raging tempest trials tribulations appearing insurmountable hurdles face knowing deep inside strength comes persevering face adversity choices pave way future unknown steps walk courage forge ahead forging onward boundless endless well springs resilience seeming endless depths inner resource wellsprings never-ending possibilities emerge victory waiting horizon rising dawn continued steadfast resolved moving ahead triumph overcoming odds stacked high against survival testing limits pushing boundaries known safety comfort zones venture forth untouched territories hoping better shores lie ahead respite weary soul seeking solace find peace within solace found deep quiet hours long nights beckoning slumber come rest heavy eyes drifting dreams sweet reprieve lulls clamor daily life sings gentle lullabye soothing ache longing heart wanting healing wounds scars hidden long forgotten times reclaiming power vulnerability courage embracing wholeheartedly faults imperfections perfections awaiting embrace shedding layers pain hurt sorrow bitter stings past dissipate harmonize melody played strings life’s orchestra symphony resonating vibrations love unending compassion guiding force universe surrounding energy pure radiant glowing warm embrace comforting reassuring whisper soft breeze reality dream woven fabric time eternity stretches onward forward backward infinite loops circles concentric overlapping layers weave intricate tapestry destinies intertwined interconnected cosmic dance celestial bodies twinkle sky alight brilliance shimmering hope eternal flame burning brightly kindling extinguished beacon guided ships treacherous waters tempest tossed seas sailing destination peaceful harbor welcome arms open wide greet traveler weary paths end meet beginning cycle refreshed renewed invigorated charging forth zeal newfound strength reborn afresh revitalized renewed purpose facing challenges adversities head-on chin held high unwavering resolve proclamation echoed throughout halls time hall fame proclaiming victory attained battles fought fiercely valiantly warrior spirit shining brilliant luminescence illuminating darkness lost souls seeking anchor lifeline profound words spoken softly resonate echoes times space folded rippled weaving fabric universe whisper intricate threads connecting lives destinies intertwined weaving intricate patterns master design grand tapestry weft meaning purpose existence unfurled full bloom blooming flowers spring bursting forth soil rich fertile growth nourishing sustenance roots dig deep foundation steadfast sturdy resilient verdant fields stretch far wide reaching horizons uncharted territories beckon explorers hearts daring brave undaunted fearless daring embarking perilous journeys unknowns seeking truths lie buried beneath sands time immemorial expounding wisdom gathered stories untold realms yet discovered veiled mysteries awaiting seeker bold enter places unseen hidden revealed eye beholder watching patiently waiting\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

I feel like I'm trapped in a nightmarish existence, surrounded by people yet consumed by an overwhelming sense of loneliness. Dealing with intense feelings of abandonment, I also struggle to connect with others despite their openness. The act of being ghosted provides little insight and only fuels my paranoia. It saddens me even more that most encounters seem driven by the desire for fleeting physical pleasure, whereas all I truly crave is genuine human connection. My past experiences have been colored by a desperate need for someone to stay, leading me down dark paths in pursuit of stability.\n\nThis is not a cry for attention or a plea for salvation, but rather a solemn reality check. platitudes such as \"don't give up\" offer no solace or solutions. The notion that my troubles are temporary rings hollow when each day seems bleaker than the last. My fear of death is overshadowed by my ineptitude in contemplating methods to end my suffering.\n\nEvery morning starts with agony coursing through my body, followed by a day shrouded in both physical pain and mental anguish. Nights are plagued by anxiety about the nightmares that sleep may bring or the fear of vulnerability to predators. The world appears unrelentingly harsh and devoid of miracles - a ruthless realm where pain reigns supreme and empathy is overshadowed by selfish motives.\n\nIf you are clinging onto hope for a miraculous turnaround, the bitter truth is that no savior awaits you. It seems that our world has evolved into an arena fueled by brutality and heartlessness. At times like these, it feels like ending it all may be the only respite from an endless cycle of suffering and disillusionment.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

Opening up seems impossible as every time I try, I either share a fraction of what's going on or pretend that everything is magically better now. There's only one person I feel comfortable talking to, and for some reason, confiding in anyone else, even my own mother, feels impossible. This individual happens to be the mother of one of the popular girls and also a teacher whom I've known for years without really knowing her well. Despite having other long-time acquaintances who are teachers, reaching out to them feels out of the question. Interacting with a stranger is equally daunting, and my encounters usually end with me insisting that everything is fine when it's far from the truth.\n\nNot too long ago, I tried confiding in a teacher and ended up regretting it after months of dialogue. I felt intrusive burdening her with my ongoing struggles when she had her own life to tend to. Apologetically, I backed away promising not to bother her again, leading to silence between us since then. Attempts at seeking help elsewhere have resulted in me retracting into myself each time by claiming that I've miraculously recovered.\n\nThe truth is far from everyone's assumption that I'm doing okay – internally, I am falling apart rapidly. It terrifies me to admit it but contemplating self-harm has become incessant; yet, the only thing holding me back from acting on those thoughts is my loyal dog. In solitude for quite some time now, others remain oblivious to the storm raging within me.\n\nFacing this inner turmoil has brought me to an acceptance that ending my life appears inevitable in the near future. Although unsure of exactly when this might happen, thoughts of suicide persist relentlessly while self-harm serves as a temporary release valve.

I am exhausted from the constant worry and stress. The untreated health anxiety is overwhelming me to the point where I feel like giving up. The smallest incidents, like getting shocked from cleaning a light switch, send me spiraling into panic and lead me to contemplate ending my life. Despite receiving reassuring results such as a clear EKG and stable heart rate at the ER, my mind continues to race with fear. The recent positive COVID-19 test has added to my distress, along with feeling misunderstood by doctors regarding my health issues like a liver parasite infection.\n\nI find myself torn between wanting to end it all due to the overwhelming physical symptoms I experience daily, which include liver pain and lightheadedness, and desperately clinging on for the sake of my relationship and future aspirations. My efforts to seek medical help have been met with skepticism, despite presenting what I believe are clear signs of a liver fluke infection. It's frustrating that a simple treatment could potentially resolve all of these issues but isn't being taken seriously by medical professionals. All I truly desire is to regain my health so that I can lead a normal life with my girlfriend and pursue my fitness goals without constant pain or worries about misdiagnoses.\n\nThe continuous cycle of being dismissed by doctors while struggling with debilitating symptoms has left me feeling hopeless and contemplating drastic measures just for some relief.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

My parents only seem interested in my academic performance which is currently poor; if I fail, they'll likely take everything away from me. I find it impossible to speak up in school or engage with anyone there; always isolated, enduring mockery even in the restroom. I don't understand why everyone picks on me - scared of every interaction, terrified of speaking up - too afraid to approach the school counselor for fear of them informing my parents about everything that's going on. People lash out at me all the time; genuine social connections elude me as loneliness pervades every aspect of my life.

The school psychologist is not an option as their involvement would lead to repercussions from my parents who would likely strip away everything from me; even reaching out to suicide hotlines proves futile due to unavailability combined with persistent bullying both offline and online.\n\nThe combination of enduring endless solitude at school alongside relentless bullying faced since early childhood has left me convinced that this year will mark the end of my life by suicide.\n\nFriendship has always eluded me.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

Enduring the wait was a challenge as I had pinned my hopes of escaping on college. The concept of life itself is elusive to me, as it feels like something that doesn't truly belong to me. I harbor deep resentment towards MY parents who are both abusive and have financial control over me, trapping me in this suffocating existence. I lack financial independence, a driver's license, and meaningful friendships, leaving me feeling like a hopeless failure who sees death as the only way out. I find myself embodying the persona that is ridiculed by everyone at school; even during virtual classes on Zoom, where I struggled with stuttering during a presentation, becoming the target of mockery from my crush, the closest semblance of a friend in that class, and even my teacher. My contempt extends not only to them but also towards my parents as well. All I desire is to vanish without leaving a trace – not seeking pity or acknowledgment from those who have caused me pain. The idea of escaping to a secluded forest and ending it all weighs heavily on my mind. The only shred of hope preventing me from taking drastic action is the slim possibility of gaining admission to a distant college with a full scholarship, where no one from my past would find me again.

Even though I have art commissions, promoting my work is daunting, and I doubt anyone would be interested anyway. The lack of a driver's license due to my intense fear of driving is isolating, as no one seems to grasp the depth of my terror. The pressure to match others' achievements at my age feels suffocating – if I can't keep up, what's the point of continuing?

I used to find joy in being creative, in experimenting, and in investing time without considering it wasteful. Yet the influence of capitalism and the demand for instant gratification have significantly impacted my mindset. This wasn't how things were supposed to turn out for me, but here I am. Uncertain about where I belong or what lies ahead, I feel lost in every sense of the word. I hope to break free from these emotions soon, though there's also a possibility that I won't.

I have never been perceived as a potential partner by women; they have never acknowledged me as a romantic interest. It seems that I continuously fall short and lack the essential qualities they seek. There is always something missing in me, an intangible quality that I lack. This state of affairs has exhausted me entirely. I resent the current state of society, where social norms, matriarchy, and the prevalence of dating apps like Tinder combine to create an environment where men who are not conventionally attractive face insurmountable challenges in finding happiness. I hold deep resentment toward women for how they have treated me, consistently rejecting me or confining me to the friend zone. I am overwhelmed by these emotions and cannot endure this any longer. The world around me feels suffocating, leaving me with no solace except to drown my sorrows in alcohol as I am doing now. This existence is intolerable to me, marked only by rejection from women or offers of mere friendship that offer no comfort. The privilege that women seem to inherently possess frustrates me deeply. The desire to end my life consumes me; the future appears bleak and devoid of any possibility for improvement. The years lost and experiences foregone cannot be recovered, leading me to loathe myself profoundly.

The most distressing aspect is perhaps the unwarranted nature of these emotions; on the surface, everything appears to be in order. I possess a harmonious bond with my family, secure employment, and the means to settle my financial obligations. Yet, the overwhelming desire for self-annihilation stems solely from my own perceived shortcomings. My relationship with my body is tumultuous, plagued by long-standing issues of weight and an unrelenting self-consciousness that persists even as I make efforts to shed pounds. Despite making progress in my weight loss journey, disdain towards my physical appearance remains entrenched. My reflection reveals every imperfection, leaving little room for respite. Compounded by gender dysphoria as a transgender man undergoing testosterone therapy for two years, the incongruence between self-perception and societal recognition fuels this self-loathing further. Adding another layer to this internal conflict is my asexuality juxtaposed with a romantic inclination towards men - a combination that seems destined for rejection and solitude. The demise of my previous relationship with another transgender man hints at the likelihood that I may never measure up to conventional standards of masculinity or desirability. This perceived inadequacy is accentuated by the fear of burdening loved ones with my struggles; contemplations of withdrawal stem from a belief that everyone would fare better without having to contend with my presence - sparing friends from incessant grievances and family from the challenges of embracing a transgender offspring. The overwhelming sentiment is one of being an inadvertent source of shame and unworthiness, undeserving of affection or companionship in any form.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" in"}

It's disheartening how nonsensical everything feels now; surrender seems like the only option. Even as I articulate these feelings, I can't shake the guilt that accompanies them. The source of my own anguish is unmistakably clear – a relentless barrage of self-inflicted negativity. Despite the abuse and trauma I've endured in the past, I find myself still tethered to their influence. Existence itself feels like an inexplicable burden; why am I here, merely occupying space in others' lives? I perceive no value or purpose within myself – a life devoid of worth or significance.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" in"}

{"prompt":"I am grappling with deep emotional turmoil and pain. It's disheartening that my aunt may have noticed the scars on my leg that haven't faded for months now. I wonder if taking SN could be even more excruciating given the state of my esophagus. The idea of using nitrogen gas feels like a distant dream due to financial constraints. It's demoralizing how little regard is shown for the magnitude of one's suffering as long as they don't take their own life. It's baffling how some individuals push others to endure unbearable circumstances by preventing them from seeking release through death. Why does it seem like things won't improve? I feel utterly worthless and incompetent. Despite planning to end my life yesterday, I found myself lacking the motivation and repeated the same pattern today. My mind seems to sabotage every attempt, leaving me filled with profound regret daily. On a day like Mother's Day, thoughts of self-harm loom large. While contemplating ending it all due to my toxic family dynamics, a friend callously dismissed my struggles and then cut off contact, pushing me closer to the edge. I am left with thoughts of drowning in my bathtub as a means of escape. Farewell. The weight of existence is utterly unbearable; why have I failed at suicide eight times? It feels unjust that even in this aspect, success eludes me while I long for release from this torment. Enduring an abusive and neglectful mother who endangers everyone's well-being leaves me feeling trapped in a cycle of despair. The continuous thwarting of my suicide attempts feels like a cruel cosmic joke, forcing me to endure prolonged suffering against my will. I am beyond my breaking point — when will I be allowed peace? Life appears devoid of purpose, leaving me exhausted beyond words. Perhaps there should be options for euthanasia available to those like myself who are fed up with enduring such relentless misery. Additionally, the recent Reddit update has made typing nearly impossible due to severe lagginess — each \"improvement\" only seems to worsen user experience over time. My encounters with oxycodone from two years ago left me feeling overwhelmingly dizzy and unwell rather than the expected euphoria associated with opiates, marking my sole interactions with such substances.'\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}

Suicidal tendencies have plagued me since a young age, stemming from a childhood filled with abuse. Despite improvements in my living situation, I still struggle daily with mental health issues and self-loathing.

Besides my two friends who have been by my side for years, especially the one who called for help when I first tried something, there's also my mom. And then there's this person I deeply care for, though it seems like they don't feel the same way about me anymore. The ache of messing up something beautiful with them is almost unbearable.

Deep down, I don't want to give up, but in those moments when the train approaches – and trust me, living so close to the tracks means knowing their schedules all too well – fear overwhelms me, tears start flowing, and I retreat.

{"prompt":"What reason is there left for me to cling to hope? My life's timeline thus far clearly indicates that happiness was never destined for me. I am learning the hard way not to harbor expectations or enthusiasm for anything, as progress seems out of reach and my goals unattainable. I am tired of hearing the empty reassurances that things will magically improve. I have been striving for so long without significant changes. People preach about giving it time and such, but it all feels like mere lip service. The desire to end it all grows stronger each time my hopes are shattered by inevitable disappointment. If only there were a way to numb my emotions, perhaps then I could settle for whatever morsels life throws my way. My troubled upbringing engraved in me a deep sense of distrust towards humanity. Friends turned tormentors and parents turned oppressors, eroding any faith in human bonds. Even self-trust evades me as I recognize my role in sabotaging my own path and inflicting pain on others in misguided attempts to feel validated. It's a twisted cycle mirroring the betrayal and hurt inflicted by those around me – perhaps this suffering is what I deserve. The lack of reciprocated affection from girls amplifies this sentiment, highlighting my alienation in a world fixated on such trivialities. The weight of societal expectations around relationships and intimacy further compounds these feelings of inadequacy and isolation, pushing me into a corner where deceit seems like the only refuge from ridicule. The warped dynamics with friends underline their conditional nature – an uneasy trade-off between companionship and conformity, where deviating from the norm invites ridicule and exclusion. The prospect of being genuinely liked by a girl feels like a cruel jest at this juncture as disillusionment seeps into every aspect of social interaction, leaving me yearning for an escape from these complexities altogether. Familial ties, too, appear tenuous under scrutiny, showcasing the flaws in their supposedly unconditional love marred by expectations of compliance and conformity to their beliefs. This existential turmoil leaves me questioning the very essence of life itself – what purpose or solace does it hold when weighed down by these burdens? The fragility of relationships - be it with family, friends or romantic interests - serves only to underscore the futility of seeking validation from external sources sown in toxicity and hurtful betrayals. In this cesspool of disillusionment and despair, the allure of an end looms ever closer than anticipated.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

Despite being married, I often feel isolated in my own thoughts. I yearn for my partner to reciprocate the care and concern I offer them. It felt like they abandoned me in my darkest moments of mental struggle. Being with someone who didn't prioritize my well-being when I needed them the most has caused deep-seated wounds that seem insurmountable. The prevalence and acceptance of polyamory and open relationships exacerbate my sense of disconnection not only from friends, family, and everything else around me, but also from my significant other who should be a source of comfort during difficult times.

The concept of \"my body, my choice\" should extend to the decision of ending one's life. This notion of being forbidden to die but left to languish in a broken state is utterly deplorable.

{"prompt":"I have put together an exit bag. Strangely, this is the first time the thought of committing suicide has truly frightened me. Let's be completely honest here. When I was 15, I ingested 120 extra-strength aspirin pills. According to WebMD, such a dosage could prove fatal. It seemed like a reasonable choice at the time. I recall being berated, physically struck, experiencing auditory dulled senses, inability to stand, and the subsequent hospital visit. At 21, I bought a gun. It was my initial experience handling one. After conducting thorough research on where to aim for instant fatality, I tried to mentally prepare myself but was overwhelmed by fear of the pain upon loading the chamber and realizing a slight misalignment in the slide mechanism that prevented discharge when I initially pulled the trigger. This moment of terror deterred me from making another attempt even after detecting my error. Concerned individuals sought me out as they recognized the danger I posed to myself, ultimately leading to my hospitalization.\n\nMore recently, I procured rope that seemed sturdy enough for its intended purpose without demanding excessive strength bearing capabilities from it. I familiarized myself with partial suspension hanging techniques and believed I had correctly adjusted the noose placement. Alone in a secluded location, I proceeded with my plan but only felt increasing head pressure and pain despite tightening the noose and exerting pressure as instructed; losing consciousness proved elusive. Dejected and with a flushed face from burst blood vessels under my skin, it dawned on me that full suspension hanging would be unbearable for me.\n\nToday, my exit bag is ready for use. The meticulous preparation elicited no emotions just like many other instances in life recently given how my lifelong depression has morphed into depersonalization over the past year, rendering me feeling markedly devoid of sensation - utterly hollow inside.\n\nHowever, upon engaging the gas valve today, an unexpected panic engulfed me as it emitted a louder sound near my ear than foreseen; although theoretically painless according to expectations – or precisely what was intended – an inexplicable ache gripped my chest nonetheless prompting me to swiftly cut off the gas supply before sitting there in stunned silence.\n\nAt this juncture, mixed emotions cloud my mind. While aware that this method guarantees success when executed accurately (which it has been), grappling with the realization that there isn't anyone left in my life whom I could even pen a clichéd suicide note to stirs some sorrow within me.\n\nAcknowledging that this marks a definitive end aligning with my fears and intentions feels surreal - having wrestled with these thoughts for so long before succumbing to numbness towards everything prior; finding myself now oscillating between solitude and unease.\n\nI'm uncertain about what exactly I seek by sharing these thoughts here but am plagued by dual fears - of failing at this endeavor yet also afraid of death itself; saddened by inadvertently or intentionally driving away those few individuals who once mattered in my life through recent decisions or actions.\n\nThe overwhelming sense of loneliness and weariness weighs heavily upon me now.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}

{"prompt":"Longing for an end to it all. The burden of existence weighs heavy on me, yet I lack the courage to end it myself, leaving me yearning for someone to relieve me of this life. If only there were a way for assisted suicide to be permissible for those consumed by terminal despair. Each night, as I traverse dim alleys, a glimmer of hope flickers that someone might bring about my demise, but it remains unfulfilled. Days blur together in a ceaseless pattern of self-destructive behavior, eroding whatever remnants of hope remain. Life feels like an endless uphill battle, an unbreakable cycle that tests my endurance with each passing moment. Fleeting moments of emotional numbness offer respite, yet inevitably give way to tears that accompany my sleep. Yearning to reverse the choices that set off this downward spiral is futile, driving me towards thoughts of ending it all to cease this prolonged suffering rooted in my fear of self-destruction. Daily revelations reinforce feelings of inadequacy and isolation, both from my actions and external circumstances. Lost in the allure of drug-induced dreams lies a semblance of a more fulfilling reality, intensifying my desire for release from this defective version of myself unfit for life.

{"prompt":"I had a dream where I finally managed to end my life, which was unsettling considering that I had been trying to push thoughts of suicide out of my mind recently. It's not something I actively plan, more like a background noise that won't go away. Lately, the difficulty of successfully carrying out such an act has been weighing heavily on me. The last thing I want is to end up in a hospital or a psych ward, being forced to stay alive against my will. Last night, feeling terrible, I took a couple of Ambiens and ended up dreaming about creating the perfect noose and struggling for 15 minutes before dying. When I woke up, I felt lightheaded and struggled to catch my breath properly. Financial constraints are preventing me from seeking therapy at the moment. I am expecting some extra money next month and hope to resume therapy then, although I am doubtful about its effectiveness now. My ability to journal or monitor my thoughts has also slipped away.

{"prompt":"I intend to end my life in a few hours as November 14th approaches. I've felt like it's my time to depart, given the span from when I started sharing here (June of this year). Regrettably, my efforts have not panned out as planned; I find myself falling short on every front, and it seems this failure is the reason for my strained relationships with my parents, the absence of family support, and the lack of friendships. I harbored aspirations of a life that seemed like a distant dream, only to acknowledge that such a reality would never be within reach for me. In my circumstances, suicide feels like the only plausible way out. I've lived with numerous afflictions and endured a seemingly purposeless existence for far too long now. Everything I once held onto – possessions, wealth, aspirations – is slipping away, soon to be followed by my life itself. As others engage in joyous celebrations surrounded by loved ones and gifts tomorrow, I'll remain secluded in my room with an irreversible decision hanging over me. The life I yearned for will continue on without me. The notion of going unnoticed after death appeals to me; I wish for solitude in decay within the confines of my room. It's astounding that I've reached this point, but even more astonishing is the anticipation with which I await death.\n\nContemplating death has been far more challenging than expected... preparing oneself not mentally but practically in terms of belongings, finances, and emotions. Despite penning nearly twenty notes, deep down I realize there might be no one to read them. My room is now spotless; unnecessary accounts are closed, and remaining usernames and passwords duly noted down – tomorrow will likely see me draining my savings entirely if possible.\n\nTasked with such extensive preparations at just 70 years old makes suicide all the more appealing – who would willingly subject themselves to such laborious tasks during old age? Concerns linger over the fate of my possessions posthumously... envisioning my money benefitting charitable causes alongside higher-value items like electronics brings some solace; passing down belongings holds little significance given my solitary existence. While mentally resolved to bid farewell to this world, a fragment of worry lingers regarding what little wealth remains.\n\nEmpathy strikes for those coerced into enduring life out of guilt due to familial or social ties; privileged as it may sound being devoid of such attachments makes ending one's life somewhat easier in comparison. Every aspect of my existence seems tailored towards facilitating suicide – a state where familial or social obligations pose no hindrance whatsoever.\n\nAlthough planning out the method of ending my life was straightforward since they were merely words on paper, executing these plans will be an entirely different ordeal come Saturday when action replaces intention. It has not been an easy feat preparing for death yet fulfilling this final duty on earth brings some form of closure; may the act itself prove less arduous than its precursor.\n\nAs an intriguing twist unfolds, expulsion from school seems imminent tomorrow! Deliberately sabotaging myself today by skipping state tests knowing well that tomorrow marks the end for me indicates a conscious choice towards self-sabotage leading up to this ultimate decision... impending expulsion feels like fitting retribution at last! Wishing for utmost suffering and torment during these final days seems strangely fulfilling.\n\nShould one consider leaving notes behind for cherished individuals before embarking on their final journey? The looming reality of ending things come Saturday evokes mixed emotions - while personally eager to depart this world behind,__ wracked__ with uncertainty surrounding how dear ones will perceive events posthumously creates apprehension.__weighing__ whether sharing parting words would provide solace or inflict additional pain upon them poses a dilemma worth pondering.\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

While I understand that life holds the potential for improvement because the future remains uncertain, I am unable to envision a path forward that feels right.

The thought of failing in college and squandering valuable resources, persisting in unhealthy habits that undermine my physical health, or engaging with someone whose words trigger excessive rumination and self-doubt weighs heavily on me.

{"prompt":"Why is it always the trivial matters that push me to the breaking point and fill me with thoughts of dying? I know how nonsensical this may sound to others. It may seem insignificant, but what triggered a storm of anger, sadness, and a feeling of being fed up with everything was my parents locking the kittens in their room so they wouldn't disturb my sleep by being on my bed at night. Due to COVID restrictions, I had to take care of their kittens for a few weeks before visiting them (within our support bubble). After nearly three weeks of caring for them solo, the kittens have grown quite attached to me. I had planned to spend a week here, having even taken time off work, assuming my parents would want to spend time together with me despite the presence of the kittens. Yet, they haven't made an effort to bond with the kittens and instead feel resentful and annoyed when the kittens seek my company. The fact that they are now confined without water or a litter box in my parents' room has left me infuriated. Is it wrong for me to feel this way? Why has this specific situation driven me to tears in the garage at 3 AM, torn between resisting the urge to wander off aimlessly into the night out of sheer apathy towards my well-being right now? At this moment, I almost wish for something terrible to happen just so it would all end. The strained relationship with my parents has been a long-standing issue – they've been emotionally and spiritually abusive since my teenage years, possibly even earlier. Being here is suffocating; it makes me question why I continue subjecting myself to an environment that pushes me towards wanting non-existence. Feeling utterly alone, I'm at my breaking point. On top of everything else, a migraine is exacerbating all these emotions. There are underlying complexities beyond what's apparent here, but why is it this particular incident that has tipped me over? It feels foolish; it feels unjustified that I'm allowing myself to be consumed by anger over the kitten situation. It's maddening that they believe confining these kittens is in any way beneficial; after investing three weeks into building trust with them on my own, their attempt seems counterproductive given they've only been with them for two days.\n\n\nAfter spending hours trying fruitlessly to unravel the tangle of issues plaguing my life right now, no solutions or escapes seem visible. I'm drained; I wish for an end to it all and crave nothing more than temporary respite through sleep which eludes me. Disappearing seems like the most appealing option; existing feels unbearable.

Despite my continuous efforts to reach out, their responses are infrequent. When they do reply, it is usually with excuses like \"this week is hectic, but perhaps we can plan for the next\" — yet those future plans never materialize.\n\nWhile I comprehend that people lead busy lives, it feels to me like a recurring pattern of being left behind.

However, her comments have lingered heavily on my mind and left me unsettled. The impact of her lack of faith in me cuts deep.

I've been active on this platform since June this year, giving myself ample time to succeed, but unfortunately, that hasn't been the case. I feel like a failure in every aspect of life, which has resulted in my parents' disdain, my family's absence or passing, and the absence of any friends. The life I aspired to live was merely a fantasy reserved for a privileged few, something I knew I could never attain. Given my multitude of illnesses and the emptiness that has consumed me for so long, suicide seems like the only solution. It feels as though I shouldn't have been born in the first place, and here I am - facing the void with nothing left. As tomorrow unfolds with celebrations and merriment for others, I'll be confined to my room with a tragic end awaiting me. The life that eluded me will continue on through someone else while I fade away in solitude. The anticipation of death fills me with an unexpected sense of excitement. It's hard to believe how far I've come and how oddly enthusiastic I am about my impending demise.\n\nI wish preparing for death was simpler... organizing belongings, finances, and emotions is proving to be an arduous task beyond just mental readiness. Despite penning nearly twenty notes knowing there may be no one to read them, clearing out my room, settling accounts, documenting passwords for online assets, and planning to deplete my savings leave me grappling with the gravity of what lies ahead. Imagining myself at 70 undertaking these tasks only solidifies my resolve to end it all now; who would want to face such complexities in their twilight years? Concerns about the fate of my possessions linger - envisioning charitable donations for funds and high-value items since there's no family to inherit them gives me some solace. While mentally prepared for the end, a part of me frets over what will become of my meager finances.\n\nI sympathize with those who are compelled to carry on due to familial or social pressures while harboring a desire to depart from this world. Surprisingly privileged in having minimal ties that anchor me here against my will, suicide seems like an endpoint that life itself has led me towards by stripping everything away until familial bonds or friendships ceased being a concern. Planning how to end it all isn't as daunting as putting those plans into action – executing them will undoubtedly be vastly different this Saturday when it happens. This final act on earth beckons closer; may the actual act bring more ease than this preparatory phase.\n\nIn a strange turn of events, it seems likely that expulsion from school awaits me tomorrow! Today's deliberate self-sabotage in skipping state exams reinforces this outcome given that tomorrow marks the day I intend to take my own life.

Perhaps you're grappling with feelings of worthlessness, lacking skills that feel valuable or a sense of purpose, possibly not finding solace in religion. It's likely that thoughts wander to a hypothetical scenario where having a romantic partner could alter the course of things. Maybe your relationship with your parents was strained or suffocatingly intense, pushing you towards thoughts of seeking relief through substances. However, it's crucial to acknowledge that these suicidal thoughts may serve as a distraction, a way for the mind to escape into a world of illusion and inertia. Take comfort in the fact that even though these thoughts may surface, acting upon them remains beyond reach; the fear alone acts as a barrier. It's common for individuals to harbor self-loathing - even those who appear not to often struggle behind the facade, using it as a shield against self-awareness. If one ever decides to act on these impulses, there's no need for subtlety; if this is the path chosen, make an impactful statement rather than fading away quietly. The narrative should shift from self-blame to defiance against an unjust world - seek not validation but validation of your normalcy amidst skewed perceptions.

{"prompt":"What is happening to me is really confusing. It all started 7 months ago when I, a 17-year-old, visited a friend's lake house in April and had a fall from a tire swing that was only about 2 feet above the ground. Initially, I didn't notice anything unusual right after the fall, but later that night I began feeling sick and exhausted. Two days passed, and upon returning home, I started feeling a bit off with a foggy and fuzzy sensation in my head. After about a week of these symptoms persisting, my regular doctor diagnosed me with a concussion. As time went on and my symptoms remained unchanged, I consulted a neurologist who attributed my condition to post-concussion syndrome. What's puzzling is that I never experienced the more common symptoms associated with concussions; only this persistent fogginess.\n\nDespite seeking help from a chiropractor which proved futile, by the end of summer when I attempted to relax through golfing, things took a turn for the worse. My head no longer felt foggy; instead, it felt like there was hot water swirling inside it causing extreme discomfort. This led me to see a naturopathic doctor specializing in natural remedies, who expressed confidence in alleviating my symptoms. I underwent multiple scans including MRI, x-rays, and CT scans of my back, neck, and frontal areas before exploring treatment at a concussion clinic which unfortunately did not offer any relief prompting me to stop going.\n\nAt my mother's suggestion, I turned to CBD oil but instead of improvement, it exacerbated the inflammation in my head significantly. Subsequently seeking advice from another naturopathic doctor who recommended consulting vision specialists revealed no concerning issues. Following this and undergoing neurotransmitter testing that hinted at anxiety-related concerns led me to start using Cymbalta without much success despite varying dosages from 30mg to 60mg then back to 30mg.\n\nAs of now, nothing seems to be working for me - having tried so many avenues already has left me feeling utterly despondent not knowing what steps to take next.

Symptoms worsen upon resting my head against anything causing discomfort along with itchiness around the eyes particularly exacerbated while sitting down or laying down against something as well as an almost unbearable feeling of internal itching within my head especially evident at the back.\n\nOne peculiar observation is finding relief only when exposed to extremely cold temperatures like snow or through cold showers offering temporary respite before symptoms resurface again relentlessly leaving me in constant distress and despair.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" in"}

{"prompt":"I am exhausted from constantly battling feelings of sadness and anxiety, with only a mere 1% glimpse of happiness. The struggle with depression and anxiety has taken its toll as I have experimented with numerous antidepressants to no avail. My body seems resistant to metabolizing SSRIs or SNRIs, which are not effective for me anyway. The anxiety medications also fall short, failing to provide the relief I so desperately need and sometimes leading to dependency issues. It pains me to feel like a burden on those around me due to something that feels beyond my control, and the self-blame after getting hurt is becoming unbearable. Finding solace only in numbness induced by substances is an unsustainable way of coping. The toxic behavior of my emotionally abusive mother, who often shifts blame onto me for her own troubles or reacts angrily when I am struggling with a panic attack, adds to my despair. The thought of existing feels increasingly unbearable as I grapple with feeling isolated despite others claiming they would miss me – a glaring contrast to their current absence when I need support the most. The duplicity of people around me is disheartening, deepening the ache within my soul. Despite clinging onto the desire for happiness, it seems elusive after years of unattainability, pushing me towards surrendering and giving up hope. While contemplating the existence of an afterlife loses significance, the yearning for genuine happiness remains unfulfilled after over a decade of trying to endure this pain.

{"prompt":"I'm a 21-year-old man who feels like I'll never find love. My mental and emotional instability, along with my self-perception as weird and unattractive, make me believe that being loved is out of reach for me. All I truly desire is to have a partner to love and share my life with, but I constantly label myself a failure and foresee a future of loneliness. It's difficult for me to admit to my parents that I need help. Dealing with moderate depression and anxiety, I made the decision to quit drinking, yet surprisingly, my mental state has deteriorated further. The thought of getting out of bed seems impossible, and death feels like the only escape. With no remaining friends, seeking therapy and medication appears to be my sole lifeline. However, revealing to my parents that I require therapy is daunting as I can't afford it myself, especially considering that I usually keep them at arm's length emotionally. My life seems bound by self-sabotage; despite my attempts at self-improvement, failure is all I know, leading me to accept the idea of dying alone. Estranged from all my friends now, the bleakness ahead makes me feel ready for death—although lacking the courage to end it myself leaves me in a state of limbo hoping for an end without actively seeking it. Feeling too unnerving to exist further perpetuates these gloomy feelings. This particular evening carries the weight of potential finality—for a 21-year-old like me, Valentine's Day serves as a stark reminder of loneliness. The absence of any romantic relationships in my past solidifies the belief that such connections are forever out of reach. Recent conflicts causing rifts between me and friends only add to the pain pushing me towards thoughts of self-harm. Regrets for letting down those around me are profound as I begin entertaining notions that the world would be better off without someone like me in it; being alone forever looms larger due to my struggles with objectifying women excessively—creating fear in interactions with them and leaving control seemingly elusive over these thoughts consuming regular interactions even while watching TV or films where women are portrayed prominently for their physical attributes rather than their personalities or talents. Another Valentine's Day arrives as a cruel reminder of my perceived inadequacies—it's become routine for me to drown these sorrows in alcohol hoping not to wake up come morning. The disdain towards this holiday intensifies each year; its celebration seemingly reserved only for showcasing others' happiness leaving individuals like myself feeling insignificant and unlovable amidst loved ones enjoying companionship—a thought clawing at wounds from years spent isolated wishing for an end to the desolation that encapsulates every moment.\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

{"prompt":"I am in need of assistance. For the past decade, I have battled suicidal thoughts. Despite temporary distractions like jobs and short-term relationships, these feelings persist. Within the last two years, I have found myself seeking reasons to push away those closest to me - one misstep and you're out of my life. At 35 years old, I am fully aware that my family and friends would be devastated if I were to act on these thoughts, yet it seems as though no one truly cares at this moment. I often feel like a disconnect in social settings, almost as if I am physically present but mentally elsewhere, lost in darkness.\n\nI have reached out to hotlines and online chats for support, which provide momentary relief. However, their suggestions to consult a general practitioner (GP) and subsequently being referred to the mental health team in the UK have proven unhelpful. The interactions often come across as patronizing and insincere - sympathetic phrases uttered in a forced, cheery tone. Consequently, I have avoided responding to their calls altogether.\n\nDespite knowing that my actions will cause long-lasting pain and guilt among my loved ones when the time comes, I feel trapped in an existence that offers me no solace. I feel as though I am slowly withering away alone in my apartment; perhaps it would take months for anyone to even notice my absence. No one checks on me regularly; it is always me reaching out to them.\n\nSeveral years ago, outside of a professional setting, I confided in an acquaintance who was trained as a psychologist about intrusive thoughts. When asked about when one should be concerned by such thoughts, he mentioned acting upon a plan as a red flag. While I have not taken concrete steps towards harming myself with a rope or similar means, the ease with which I have distanced those who matter most exacerbates these tendencies.\n\nI fear becoming too comfortably numb with the idea of ending things at home where discovery might be delayed. Instead, contemplations drift towards secluded woodlands where intricate notes would signal potential passersby before carrying out my intentions dramatically for discovery by authorities later.\n\nDespite being acknowledged for intelligence and eloquence by others, this ongoing emotional turmoil signifies something deeper than transient distress related to recent events.

Despite giving myself ample time since I began reaching out here back in June, it is evident that my efforts have been futile. I feel like a failure in every aspect of life which has led to my parents' disdain, my family's absence, and the absence of friends in my life. The life I fantasized about living seems unattainable for me, and suicide feels like the only solution in this bleak situation. It seems like I was never meant to exist, burdened with various ailments and a persistent sense of emptiness. Now, as I face the prospect of parting from this world, I can't help but feel a twisted sense of relief and anticipation for what awaits me.\n\nDealing with the practicalities of death has proven to be unexpectedly challenging. From drafting numerous notes that may likely go unread to organizing my belongings, closing unnecessary accounts, and meticulously documenting passwords for the remaining ones; it has been a daunting task. As I ponder about the future where I may reach old age facing similar challenges, the idea of taking my own life becomes more appealing. Despite mentally preparing myself for death with unwavering certainty, concerns linger regarding the fate of my meager savings and possessions.\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding where my belongings will end up troubles me deeply. While envisioning my assets being donated to charity brings some solace, the absence of family to inherit anything weighs heavily on me. Although mentally resolute about my decision to end my life and spared from emotional manipulation due to lack of close ties, there is a trace of apprehension about leaving behind material possessions such as limited funds.\n\nI sympathize with individuals who are coerced into prolonging their lives due to familial or social obligations; however, being relatively unencumbered by such entanglements has streamlined my path towards suicide over time. While planning the method of ending my life didn't pose much difficulty in terms of articulation initially, executing these plans on Saturday will likely present a stark contrast. As I brace myself for the final act on this planet, completing this ultimate task feels strangely arduous — all while hoping that death itself offers a smoother transition.\n\nIn an unusual turn of events, it appears highly probable that I will face expulsion from school tomorrow! Deliberately sabotaging myself today by skipping state exams knowing that I'm set on ending my life imminently indicates reaching rock bottom in terms of consequences awaited. This impending expulsion seems like a fitting culmination reflecting upon all that led me here. The prospect of enduring heightened suffering during these final days almost feels justly deserved.\n\nContemplating whether writing farewell notes to loved ones holds any significance amid preparations for taking my own life this Saturday stirs conflicting emotions within me. While part of me grapples with the notion that not informing them could be distressing post-mortem; another part hesitates considering potential exacerbation of their pain through written farewells. Should I leave behind notes for those dear to me or spare them this additional heartache?\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

Strangely, despite holding the blade in my hand, I find myself unable to go through with it. It's frustrating not being able to take that step when I believe it would benefit everyone around me. No matter how hard I try to exude kindness and happiness, my past continues to define me as a burden. It feels like no amount of goodness can overshadow the fact that at my core, I am nothing but a weight on others' shoulders.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}
{"prompt":"I am considering admitting myself to a mental health facility at a hospital, perhaps permanently. Lately, the overwhelming suicidal thoughts have been unbearable. Moreover, my anger has escalated to a level I have never experienced before. It's like I am a frenzied animal locked in a cage, covered in numerous self-inflicted wounds that resemble the simplistic drawings of a child with poor artistic skills. I am constantly on edge and poised to erupt over the smallest inconvenience, regardless of the circumstances. I genuinely fear that this could eventually lead to me causing serious harm to someone and ending up in prison.\n\nThus, I am faced with a decision: either I go to an emergency room and disclose my suicidal intentions in order to be admitted to a psychiatric facility or I follow through with ending my life. Even now, as I contemplate my next move from home, I believe it would be in society's best interest if I remained institutionalized for the remainder of my life. With no family present to care for or miss me, the financial aspect of this situation is also uncertain. The likely scenario is that one day, I will meet my end in obscurity, just another anonymous homeless individual cremated without ceremony. However grim this may sound, it no longer holds any significance for me.\n\nSigned,\nAva\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

Subsequently, as I found myself facing a scolding from my narcissistic mother in the backyard, overwhelmed by despair, I contemplated leaping into the nearby lake with the intention of drowning since it was deep and I lacked swimming skills. Despite these thoughts, I was somehow persuaded by her not to proceed with it.

The typical response would be, \"Yes, seeking help can make things better,\" but the reality is that I don't share a close enough bond with her to comfortably open up. Mental health struggles run deep in our family, and she has endured her own battles and emerged stronger. However, I sense that she envisions me as this flawless individual destined for wealth and success, regardless of my true feelings or challenges. Whenever she notices my low spirits and questions me, her tone feels more like an accusation with phrases like \"what's wrong with you.\" While involving my parents might have its merits, the idea of taking action afterwards—like seeing a therapist—feels daunting. I avoid discussing my personal issues, and the thought of virtual therapy sessions exhausts me; if I have to face one more person through a screen, I might lose it.

I had pinned all my hopes on college as a means of escape, but now I'm questioning the meaning of life itself. It's hard to even recognize this life as my own, especially with controlling and abusive parents who hold all financial power over me, leaving me feeling like I have no autonomy. I lack resources like money, a driver's license, or a strong support system, and it's easy to believe that I am a failure who doesn't deserve to exist. The constant bullying and humiliation at school, including during online classes like Zoom where even those closest to me joined in mocking me, only adds to the pain. It's as if everyone derives joy from my suffering.\n\nThe thought of disappearing or running away to end this misery is always at the back of my mind. Despite not wanting anyone's pity or acknowledgement of their impact on me, the urge to vanish into a forest and cease to exist lingers persistently.

It may sound irrational, but it’s a way to spare my future older self from enduring further disappointments. I dread becoming that 30-year-old who still can't drive, who's never had a girlfriend, who grew up without a father, who's never experienced a kiss, or the person in their 40s still being bullied. Or worse, the 21-year-old losing hair prematurely but at least not being entirely bald while alive – sparing any future kids from witnessing my failures. I shiver at the thought of being the 50-year-old virgin or the 60-year-old man never having owned a home – and what about being the 70-year-old with no grandchildren? It's another disheartening night filled with intense anxiety and depression. The frustration towards others and oneself persists despite trying various medications without much relief. Even as I attempted a walk today and encountered two lovely girls, I couldn't bring myself to engage with them, fueling self-loathing further. Negative thoughts flood my mind now, pushing me close to tears – forgive me for being so emotionally fragile. It feels like being authentic is never sufficient; when things are going poorly in life, people seem to appreciate me more, only to turn indifferent when things are looking up – it’s perplexing. What is the essence of life really? Successful individuals can go screw themselves! Just when I disconnect from social media platforms, they bombard me with notifications as if they truly care – highlighting how inconsequential my existence might be to them if I were gone. My depression and rage are escalating uncontrollably; coupled with lingering anxiety every day, it sends my mind into chaos constantly. Neither my depression nor anxiety shows signs of waning; they're intensifying so much that even moments of tranquility lead to profound boredom as seen tonight - leaving me questioning everything around me and within me.

It's unsettling to realize that this is the very same place where someone ended their life in a similar manner six years ago. While it's true that if I truly wanted to end it all, I would have done so by now - perhaps that holds some truth.

Frankly speaking, I harbor disdain for anyone who diminishes my humanity, leaving me feeling subhuman - a sentiment that holds undeniable truth. The grip of worthlessness and inertia clings to me; plunged in ignorance and incompetence, I seem incapable of achieving anything worthwhile. Regrettably, failure seems to be my only proficiency. Paradoxically, sometimes I muse about the bliss of ignorance so profound that the complexities of the world remain beyond reach. In such a state, perhaps finding joy in simple pleasures would come effortlessly.

Loneliness consumes me during nights when the world feels desolate; paradoxically, reaching out is undoubtedly out of the question as I hold contempt for those around me. Strangely enough, embracing fear appears to be necessary; welcoming all forms of negativity like shards piercing through skin or retching blood - all consuming pain is what I seek.\n\nContemplating my current state leads to profound despair.

Originally, it was believed that ADHD would dissipate during puberty, but that notion proved to be incorrect. Instead, it exacerbated over time, transforming me into someone constantly unfocused and disengaged – akin to the stereotypical character portrayed on television. Tasks now require immense effort unless they pique my interest, and very little captivates me unless I am fixated on it to an extreme extent where I could recite its entire Wikipedia page verbatim.\n\nThe onset of ADHD stripped away my ability to connect socially and behave like a typical individual. The assessments made about me back then were entirely accurate. Regrettably, I did exhibit inappropriate behavior such as trying to look up girls' skirts, influenced by the anime content I was obsessed with at the time. Consequently, I became and continue to feel like an erratic outcast. My repetitive behavior of re-reading books incessantly earned me relentless bullying throughout middle school – marking the first instance in which I vocally expressed a desire to end my life, a sentiment that has lingered close ever since.\n\nI harbor profound fear in my interactions with people, not out of meeting them but due to the dread of losing them. As accurately articulated by my best friend: \"I deal with him.\" My tendencies toward making cryptic remarks devoid of context that only make sense to me often alienate individuals around me. Speaking impulsively has caused unintentional harm along the way. Once during a moment of vulnerability, my mother even insinuated that any potential divorce between her and my father would be solely because of me – a burden that I have carried with me.\n\nDespite being seemingly privileged – being white, male, attending a private school with affluent parents who ensured a seamless college education devoid of financial burdens – I managed to squander every advantage bestowed upon me. Armed with two seemingly futile degrees incapable of securing any promising prospects ahead and landing a job at my mother's workplace as a safeguard against trouble – only culminating in dismissal due to displaying suicidal tendencies within the probationary period.\n\nHowever, above all else, an overwhelming sense of loneliness consumes me daily. Crippled by self-doubt and insecurity about my physical appearance and lacking social acumen further intensifies when relating especially with women – knowing fully well that on merits alone, deserving companionship seems far-fetched for someone like myself.\n\nContinuous relationship failures within weeks have taken their toll profoundly prompting reflections about the pointlessness of continuing this cycle. Despite attempting therapy without favorable outcomes and medication tranquilizing whatever little joy my routines may offer deprives life's essence further.\n\nUltimately, the desire for normalcy persists alongside an overpowering urge for release from this burdensome existence.

Instead, it has intensified, transforming me into the stereotypical, endlessly distracted individual seen on TV. Everything now requires a high level of interest for me to engage with it, and very little captures my attention unless I am fixated to the point of reciting entire Wikipedia pages verbatim. My social skills diminished when this change occurred. The accusations made against me were accurate; I did exhibit inappropriate behavior like trying to peek under girls' skirts due to an obsession fostered by anime. I have become an erratic misfit, appearing as a creep because of my actions and habits like repeatedly rereading the same books. Consequently, I faced relentless bullying in middle school, leading me to articulate my desire to die for the first time in my life—a sentiment that has lingered ever since.\n\nI harbor a deep fear of losing people rather than meeting them, alienating everyone with my peculiar and contextually nonsensical remarks that often unknowingly offend others due to my thoughtless speech. The weight of causing parents' divorce hung on me following a warning from my mother which eventually came true. Despite starting with many opportunities—being white, male, attending private school with affluent parents who provided a full college scholarship—I squandered it all. My two seemingly pointless degrees offer no prospect for the future while losing a job at my mother's office due to suicidal tendencies during probation only added to the list of failures.\n\nBeyond anything else, loneliness consumes me as I yearn for connections I know are beyond reach based on my shortcomings—anxiety peaks especially around women due to ingrained self-image issues and poor interpersonal skills leading every relationship to crumble within weeks. Therapy fails to ease my struggles while medication numbs any fleeting happiness left within me.\n\nI am exhausted from carrying this burden; death seems like the only respite that would cease being a burden on others. The question lingers about how one can end their own life without leaving behind burdensome remains for their parents to handle—a reflection of how desperate the longing for normalcy truly is.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

Please, I beg of you, transform me into a conventional man who enjoys masculine activities rather than being attracted to men. I yearn for a life free from these struggles; please perform a miracle and rid me of this perpetual cycle of sadness, isolation, and rejection. I apologize for my shortcomings; all I desire is to fit in and live without the burden of depression and negative thoughts clouding my mind. Heavenly Father, please grant me this miracle by removing any traces of homosexuality, gender dysphoria, depression, and all other adversities from my life.

{"prompt":"I'm an 18-year-old male and finding it hard to put my feelings into words. I've been engaging in self-harm for quite some time, starting off small but now my entire body is marked with scars. It was a way for me to turn emotional pain into physical pain. I've been feeling emotionally numb since the age of 12. Discharged from the military due to mental health issues, I was sent to a psychiatrist for an assessment. The diagnosis was sociopathy and self-injury. Lately, thoughts of suicide have been consuming me as life holds no happiness for me; I lack love for anyone, constantly lie, and hurt others without reason.\n\nLast summer, I got engaged to a girl who annoys me incessantly. Despite being together out of habit and her genuine care for me, my thoughts shifted a month ago when I reconnected with an ex-girlfriend who has been through some profound changes since we last met - she battles depression and has suffered multiple occurrences of sexual assault. As we rekindled our connection, I found myself drawn to her for reasons unknown; perhaps because she is as broken as I am or maybe because we share many similarities.\n\nWe spent a night together, and surprisingly, I felt something other than emptiness - happiness. However, after leaving the next morning, thoughts of her consumed me, prompting me to reach out again to no avail. Distressingly, she attempted suicide by cutting her wrists while intoxicated and was consequently admitted to a mental facility with an uncertain release date.\n\nDespite this turmoil, she has agreed to pursue a relationship with me but remains undecided about taking her own life. We made a pact that if she chooses that path, we do it together - but now I'm utterly lost. Before meeting her, life seemed unbearable; if she leaves this world, my will to live diminishes too - ending it all seems inevitable now.\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

{"prompt":"The struggles of feeling unattractive weigh heavily on me. It's disheartening to experience condescension, unkindness, and a sense of being treated as lesser by others, as if interacting with me is an act of charity on their part. The constant criticism and the feeling that my flaws are magnified for no apparent reason have left me feeling utterly despondent. The thought of continuing to live under such circumstances is becoming increasingly unbearable, fuelling feelings of anger and contemplating ending it all.\n\nIt's a painful realization to observe how differently people treat me when I have my mask on, offering a glimpse of humane treatment that seems elusive otherwise. Growing up, I have endured the distressing feeling of being dehumanized due to what I perceive as having a somewhat \"odd\" facial appearance - with some features considered appealing but overshadowed by what I see as unattractive traits in the lower half of my face.\n\nThe kindness and empathy shown towards me when my face is hidden behind a mask only serves to accentuate the harsh contrast in treatment. The financial barrier preventing me from pursuing plastic surgery further exacerbates my sense of helplessness in addressing this issue. The accumulation of past traumas, from enduring abuse within my family to enduring bullying throughout school, has taken a toll on my mental well-being.\n\nStruggling with social interactions due to being consistently sidelined has deepened my sense of isolation and discontentment with life.

Although it provides some relief, I find myself contemplating whether or not I should confide in them about my struggles. Lately, every interaction with them fills me with the unsettling thought that it could potentially be our final exchange. Even during our DND sessions, I can't shake off the feeling that it might be my last game. A recent post on Tumblr discussing the aftermath of suicide and its impact on loved ones triggered a wave of tears. There are four friends in particular whom I fear for, and the mere idea of how my actions could affect them, as well as my sibling, fills me with self-loathing for even considering such a drastic step. This guilt-ridden cycle is consuming me, yet I am unable to address it currently.

Even though none of these steps have been taken, the urge to hang myself persists. I have briefly tested the method by placing a rope around my neck and simulating hanging for a short while.

I feel like no one can rescue me from this torment, as I am trapped amidst these agonizing emotions and those responsible for causing them.\n\nMy circumstances force me to share a home with a mother who has become fanatically religious, excessively doting on my autistic sister. The powerlessness in my current situation only heightens the despair I feel, leading me towards thoughts of ending it all. Adding to this are the layers of more conventional trauma within my family dynamic. My experiences have been overshadowed by neglect and mistreatment from my family members. For instance, despite trying to cover my dental expenses through a low-paying job, I was coerced into purchasing a car that led to financial strain due to accidents and insurance costs.\n\nThe disregard for my well-being is evident in how my feelings are dismissed by my mother whenever I try to express them. Even after surviving meningitis and enduring the loss of hearing in one ear, her response tends to be dismissive rather than empathetic. Her lack of understanding amplifies the emotional turmoil caused by incidents like the abusive behavior exhibited by my older sister's partner which she chose not to address appropriately.\n\nFurthermore, external factors at school exacerbate these struggles as I find myself surrounded by an overly zealous left-wing mindset that tends to generalize blame onto entire groups without considering individual perspectives or experiences. This toxic environment only adds another layer of complexity as my own moderate beliefs are often misunderstood by those within this ideological bubble.\n\nThe missed opportunities for a normal life due to familial circumstances intensify the sense of injustice and utter frustration with how things have unfolded.

These experiences have led me to traverse the darkest aspects of life, bearing witness to some of the most horrifying instances imaginable. However, despite all this, I persist.

{"prompt":"Why should I bother holding on to hope anymore? It's crystal clear from every single chapter of my life so far that happiness was never meant for me. I have to train myself to guard against getting my hopes up or feeling excitement because things just never improve, and my goals will always remain out of reach. Spare me the generic pep talks about how things are bound to improve. I've been striving for a better life for so long. People keep advising me to be patient and all that nonsense, but let's be real, that doesn't change anything. I am overwhelmed with the desire to end it all. Each time I allow myself to hope for something, the pain of eventual failure cuts even deeper. I wish there were a way to numb my emotions, so I could settle for whatever scraps life throws at me. My upbringing was an absolute nightmare. It's probably the reason why I'm such a mess now. Friends bullied me and my parents physically abused me, teaching me not to trust a single soul. Even friends and family are not exempt; they'll betray and inflict pain if you don't conform to their expectations. I can't even trust myself; it turns out that I'm the one destroying my own life. And yes, I have also done some unspeakable things – like bullying others just to feel superior. In many ways, I've become just like those friends and family members who have hurt me; perhaps, suffering is what I deserve. But then why do none of my so-called \"friends\" suffer like I do? Maybe it's time they faced some agony too under my hand. As if things weren't already bleak enough, no woman has ever shown interest in me either. It feels pathetic that this bothers me so much but it's more than just romantic involvement; connecting with someone romantically seems impossible for me while others gladly ridicule me for being inexperienced with relationships or sex.I resorted to lying about it to save face in front of friends who seemed more concerned about my virginity than I ever was; their constant mocking pushed me to fabricate stories about nonexistent conquests because apparently friendships demand conformity or else you're exposed to bullying.But the idea of a girl actually genuinely liking me is nothing short of a joke at this stage.I often fantasize about being asexual just so I wouldn't have to navigate these complexities involving girls.Family holds no significance; you exist simply because two individuals decided to procreate.Sure, they claim to love me but those beatings under the guise of discipline make one question their intentions.Dad probably thought he was doing right when he used his belt on 8-year-old-me each time shoelaces remained untied.So should gratitude be in order?

{"prompt":"I am in desperate need of assistance. For the past decade, I have been battling suicidal thoughts. Despite temporarily distracting myself with jobs and short-lived relationships, these feelings persist. Lately, I have been intentionally pushing away those closest to me by finding excuses to cut them out of my life. At 35 years old, I acknowledge that my family and friends would be devastated by my absence, but it feels like no one truly cares at the moment. I often feel disconnected and as though I am merely existing in a dark place where visibility is nonexistent.\n\nWhile I have reached out to hotlines and online chats for support, their help only provides temporary relief. I have followed the advice to visit a GP, who subsequently referred me to the mental health team in the UK. However, I found their approach patronizing and unhelpful, as they responded with sympathetic yet superficial questions like \"Do you have any hobbies?\" in an attempt to uplift me. Feeling that their support was insincere, I stopped engaging with them.\n\nAlthough I understand that my actions will likely cause immense pain and guilt among my loved ones if I go through with ending my life, at the same time, existing in this manner feels unbearable. It seems like I am decaying away alone in my flat without anyone noticing for an extended period—perhaps even two months before anyone realizes.\n\nI recall a conversation with a psychologist from a few years back, although it was informal and outside a professional setting. We discussed intrusive thoughts, and he mentioned that action should be taken when a plan is formulated. While I have not proceeded to take drastic measures such as acquiring a rope for self-harm purposes, it troubles me how effortlessly I have distanced myself from those who matter most.\n\nI believe that my current state of mind is transient and influenced by recent events. Although this bleak outlook will likely pass within days or weeks, the knowledge that these feelings may resurface in the future is daunting.\n\nReflecting on past behaviors from childhood—marked by aggression towards myself through self-harm and towards others through bullying—I suspect underlying mental health conditions such as psychosis, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder.\n\nIs it true that hormonal imbalances can indicate bipolar disorder while schizophrenia can be detected through specific tests? If so, how can I compel my doctor to conduct these tests? Despite recognizing these potential conditions within myself, no diagnosis or medication has been prescribed for them or for my persistent depressive state.\n\nDuring interactions with healthcare professionals or mental health teams, I often feel incapable of fully expressing the depth of my emotions and experiences.\n\nSeeking input or suggestions regarding potential diagnoses or suitable medications specifically available in the UK would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, recommendations for literature aimed at shifting mindset patterns or enhancing coping mechanisms are welcome.\n\nIn closing,\n- Tom\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

It was his time to depart - he has been in hospice and battling severe health issues for quite a while. Strangely, his passing has, in a way, extended my life's duration.

What adds to my burden is the guilt I feel for even harboring such thoughts. On the surface, things seem to be in order - I have a supportive family, a job that pays the bills - yet, I can't shake off this overwhelming desire to cease existing. My self-image has always been tainted by my weight issues; though I've embarked on a weight loss journey, the disdain for my appearance lingers. The unrelenting struggle with gender dysphoria as a transgender man compounds the self-loathing. Despite two years on testosterone, society still perceives me as female, and I lack the courage to correct them. The intersection of weight insecurities and gender dysphoria intensifies my self-reproach.\n\nAdding to this mix is my romantic and sexual identity - being attracted to men while possibly identifying as asexual. The fear of never being accepted or loved looms large. Past experiences have left scars; feeling inadequate in a relationship with another transgender man eroded my sense of worth even further. The constant battle against societal norms and personal desires makes me feel like an outcast within an already marginalized group.\n\nWhile thoughts of ending it all linger in the background, it's more about sparing others from having to deal with my presence - sparing friends from listening to endless complaints and family from the challenges of accepting a transgender member. The overwhelming feeling of embarrassment and unworthiness clouds any sense of deserving love or companionship - from friends and family alike.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" in"}

Despite giving myself ample time since I first reached out here in June of this year, I have faced nothing but failure. Every aspect of my existence has been a series of setbacks, which has led to the disdain of my parents, the departure or passing of my family members, and the absence of any genuine friendships. The ideal life I once envisioned was a mere fantasy that I knew I would never attain. Ending my life seems like the only logical solution in my case, for I should never have been brought into this world in the first place. Struggling with numerous illnesses has condemned me to a life devoid of meaning for far too long. Everything that once held value to me—my possessions, finances, aspirations—is now meaningless.

Worries linger about the fate of my possessions; envisioning my money going towards charity along with valuable items like electronics gives me solace knowing that there's no family legacy to pass on—which is fine with me.\n\nPity washes over me thinking about those who desire death but are coerced into living due to familial or friendship obligations—a privilege I don't share as suicide has always been on the horizon for me.\"\n\n\"Quite an unexpected turn—I'll likely face expulsion from school tomorrow!

The existence of individuals who are genetically disadvantaged in terms of looks cannot be denied. Those who can relate will comprehend my sentiments when I express my frustration with genetics.

Simply attempting to motivate myself to study for exams without breaking down into tears is proving to be an exceedingly challenging task. My mental well-being throughout this school year has been distressingly poor. Other than sporadically talking to one person besides my parents, I have isolated myself. Juggling numerous incomplete assignments, it's somewhat of a miracle that I am managing to maintain a C- in my most challenging classes. Now faced with the realization of the mounting backlog of unfinished work that I neglected, I have discovered that I am unable to submit them as per the syllabus guidelines that I overlooked, stating no more extensions due to the completion of our last test. The upcoming AP Biology exam on Thursday feels like an insurmountable obstacle. My lack of focus over the past semester is reflected in my current grade of C-, which heavily relies on using quizlet during every test. The thought of continuing like this is unbearable. While I understand intellectually that it's merely two weeks until all this will be over, the emotional strain feels insurmountable. Just last Thursday, I had another AP exam and all I can recall from that period is endless hours of studying intertwined with tearful nights alone. It's disheartening to admit that suicide has crossed my mind now when previously it was never a consideration throughout this year and some additional time before it. Were it not for my parents, whom I must admit are placing high expectations on me without even articulating them directly, I honestly wouldn't care at this point. They see me as intelligent, a fact that even I acknowledge about myself; however, they remain unaware of the turmoil plaguing my mind for so long now. Growing older has brought with it more conversations from my parents about future plans – what college to attend, what field to specialize in, what career path to pursue thereafter – but truth be told, I'm lost and uncertain about it all. This is something I've been wanting to express for a while now: the confusion and indecision are overwhelming me. Until recently, deep contemplations about such weighty matters never crossed my mind; rather, my focus was set on trying to find fleeting moments of joy each day amidst the ongoing quarantine period. My so-called friends have all drifted away from me now as well.

Enduring both physical and emotional abuse from my partner, I have kept silent about it due to the emasculating nature of disclosing such details. The difficulty lies in admitting that my female partner engaged in physical altercations during arguments at home. Despite her persistent urging over the years for me to seek therapy, especially exacerbated by the circumstances of Covid-19, I dedicated significant effort to self-improvement and mental well-being. Regrettably, she grew averse to this transformed version of me. Now in my thirties, I feel like a wasted existence with no purpose to serve.

Their outbursts appear unwarranted over trivial matters, creating an atmosphere of unpredictability that leaves me uneasy. It seems that while they may not reprimand me for academic setbacks, they exhibit frustration over insignificant issues like stray hairs on the floor - a behavior that leads me to suspect my mother may be struggling with OCD. Despite their evident love for me, characterized by moments of tenderness that shine through amidst the chaos, they seem incapable of containing their propensity to yell.\n\nI believe that perhaps the only way to mitigate this cycle is if I strive for perfection - perfect grades, immaculate surroundings, proactive help around the house. Though I imagine their yelling might persist, it could potentially lessen if I meet these lofty standards. However, this continual pursuit feels draining; some days even getting out of bed before noon proves to be a daunting task. The weight of perceived inadequacy and continual self-criticism drags me down into a pit of despair; anxiety and depression loom overhead like relentless storm clouds.\n\nMy reliance on Adderall and Paxil has been a lifeline in navigating these mental health challenges - fostering an ability to engage with others without fear and maintain focus on academics. Yet despite these strides, moments arise where it all comes crashing down; in those instances, even my faith feels distant and unattainable.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read through this outpouring of thoughts.

Recently, my sister welcomed her first child into the world on June 3rd, and my birthday is approaching on the 14th. These are supposed to be moments of celebration, yet I find myself unable to feel the happiness I should. The weight of my persistently negative thoughts is draining me. Since childhood, I have battled with this internal turmoil, struggling to remember the last time true happiness touched me. It all feels so senseless now; I am overwhelmed with the desire to surrender. Even as I write this, guilt consumes me for harboring such emotions. I recognize that I am the source of my own suffering, feeding myself a diet of self-deprecating thoughts each day. Despite the abuse and trauma of my past, I still allow them to shape my present and future. Why do I continue to exist in the lives of others? What purpose do I serve?

From the beginning, my family dynamics were far from ideal - a mother who never really wanted me, a father who was overly critical, a brother and sister who didn't seem to care for me at all. I constantly felt like I failed to meet their expectations as a daughter and sibling. While my relationship with my father has improved over time, I still can't shake the feeling that he deserves someone better than me, someone who isn't so messed up.\n\nMy upbringing was filled with emotional and mental torment inflicted by my own family, and to make matters worse, I experienced sexual abuse as a child. The weight of multiple diagnoses has been placed on my shoulders, so much so that the doctors have labeled it as having a bit of every disorder out there. As a coping mechanism, I retreated into the world of video games, seeking solace from a society that already feels like it's against me.\n\nI found some semblance of companionship online with someone I thought was older but turned out to be just 14 years old. Despite our interactions being purely platonic and light-hearted banter, I made an inappropriate comment one drunken night which I deeply regret. Though he forgave me and assured me it was okay, I can't shake off the guilt and self-loathing plaguing my mind.\n\nFeeling like an outsider in my own age group, struggling to form connections with peers due to my delayed mental development according to my doctor - it all adds up to this overwhelming sense of depression and self-disgust that consumes me. Regretting each misstep along the way, feeling like an irreparable mistake that should never have existed in the first place.\n\nThe idea of being seen as a societal outcast by both others and myself looms large in my thoughts. The desire to end this inner turmoil becomes more enticing with each passing moment. Feeling beyond repair, damaged beyond recognition - thoughts of ending it all seem like the only relief left.\n\nI've contemplated suicide before but failed in those attempts. Now, with an unwavering determination fueled by despair and regret, I am considering trying again this weekend - this time making sure not to repeat past mistakes.\n\nI apologize profusely for any harm or discomfort I may have caused throughout all this chaos in my mind and life.

My thoughts feel inadequate, stemming from a mind that mistakenly considers itself intelligent when, in reality, it's merely misguided. It's as though I am worthless except for my physical attributes. I even degrade myself to the point of offering them for payment, emphasizing just how little value I see in myself. The idea of not even deserving a place in the kitchen further solidifies my belief that I have no worth at all. In this state of despair, ending my own life seems like the only solution.

{"prompt":"The demands of my job are overwhelming, and the thought of quitting feels impossible. Lately, the idea of ending my life has been creeping into my mind. In summary, working in retail has taken a toll on my physical well-being, but I can't afford to stop as it would cause a family uproar. My life feels stagnant, and all I crave after work is rest. The meager pay I receive is also divided with my mother, leaving me with little to show for my efforts. Contemplating suicide as an escape from this cycle has become a recurring thought. While I don't want to play the victim, it seems like the circumstances of my life have been leading me towards failure or making success incredibly challenging. I attribute some of this struggle to my family dynamics; being raised by a single mother in a household of women has limited me in many ways.\n\nCurrently, I am stuck in a job that isn't fulfilling and commuting in a way that is detrimental to my health. The physical demands of work coupled with the strain of commuting leave me with no time for self-care or recovery. The financial strain is relentless as well, with most of my earnings going towards bills and healthier food choices due to my family's dietary habits. Each paycheck barely covers expenses, leaving me feeling powerless and inadequate. It feels like I'm carrying not just my own burdens but those that society traditionally expects men to bear within a family structure.\n\nDespite being 27 years old and approaching 28 soon, I feel trapped in this cycle without any prospects for change or growth. My body is consistently worn out, making it difficult to prioritize exercise as before. If I consider leaving my job, my mother would likely perceive it as giving up without seeking alternative opportunities - a perception that frustrates me immensely. The lack of progress or support in my current environment makes me question the purpose of getting up each morning.\n\nIn conclusion, the constant struggle and lack of advancement make it seem like exiting this situation before it deteriorates further might be the best course of action for me.

I'm weary of society's infatuation with crafting a distinct persona and upholding a virtuous image. Everyone seems to expect individuals to conform to their expectations.

My true desire is not for death, but for an end to the relentless pain I am experiencing.

This current existence of mine, devoid of joy, seems unbearable. The thought of enduring this indefinitely overwhelms me; I can't envision persisting like this for much longer.

{"prompt":"I have assembled an exit bag, a method of suicide that has genuinely frightened me like never before. To be completely honest, at the age of 15, I ingested 120 extra-strength aspirin tablets with the hope of ending my life, despite knowing the potential fatal consequences outlined by WebMD. The experience was a blur of being yelled at, slapped, deafened, unable to stand, and culminated in a hospital visit. \nAt 21, I acquired a gun for the first time and meticulously researched where to aim it on my head to ensure a swift outcome. However, the fear of the anticipated pain was so overwhelming that even after loading it and realizing a slight technical error that prevented firing upon pulling the trigger, I couldn't summon the courage to try again. Concerned friends discovered my intentions and ultimately led to my hospitalization.\nMore recently, I obtained rope designed to support my weight for partial suspension hanging. Despite carefully positioning the noose and carrying out my plan in seclusion, all I experienced was excruciating pressure in my head without losing consciousness. The failed attempt left me battered and bruised but made me realize that a full hanging would be unbearable.\nNow with an exit bag prepared flawlessly and feeling detached due to evolving depression into depersonalization over time, I embarked on this method but was startled by the noise and physical sensations as I turned on the gas. While logically aware it shouldn't cause pain, my chest tightened nonetheless.\nAlthough confident in the effectiveness of this method if executed correctly (which I have done), facing the fact that there is no one left in my life whom I could leave a final message to stings. Acknowledging that this is truly happening aligning with my deepest fears feels surreal.\nAfter grappling with suicidal thoughts for an extended period until reaching emotional numbness, being on this precipice now leaves me oscillating between feelings of loneliness and anxiety. Unsure of what exactly I seek by sharing this narrative but terrified of both failing at this endeavor and confronting death simultaneously; sad about unknowingly driving away those few individuals in my life through my actions or inactions.\nThe overwhelming sense of solitude and weariness weighs heavily on me right now.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}
{"prompt":"I'm overwhelmed by anxiety when I think about what lies ahead. Just the thought of mustering the energy to study for exams without breaking down in tears feels like an insurmountable task. My mental well-being has taken a severe dip throughout this school year. Besides my parents, I've only confided in one other person occasionally. The stack of incomplete assignments keeps growing, and it's nothing short of a miracle that I'm barely scraping by with a C- in my toughest subjects. Now, as I face all the overdue work that needs to be turned in according to the syllabus I failed to read—stating no late submissions after our recent test—it's hitting me hard. And let's not even start on my looming AP Biology exam scheduled for Thursday. I've been virtually absent-minded this entire semester, relying solely on quizlet during tests to maintain that C-. The pressure is suffocating. Although it's just two more weeks until this is all over, the weight on my shoulders feels unbearable. The agony from last Thursday's AP exam is still fresh in my mind—the endless studying sessions punctuated with tearful nights. It's unsettling how suicide has crossed my mind now when it never did throughout this challenging year and then some. If it weren't for my parents, I wouldn't care at all. Their unspoken expectation of excellence weighs heavily on me; they believe in my intellect, as do I, but they are unaware of the turmoil brewing inside me for so long. With every passing day, my parents delve deeper into discussions about the future—college choices, majors, and career paths—and I have no answers. It's a confession I've been withholding: \"I don't know.\" Amidst this uncertainty lies a profound sense of confusion that has only become apparent as I deal with trying to find happiness each day since quarantine began. My once steadfast 'friends' have distanced themselves from me, leaving me isolated and adrift. The activities that used to bring solace no longer hold any comfort; their support as mental crutches has crumbled suddenly and inexplicably. In the midst of this turmoil, I can't help feeling ashamed for venting about these deeply rooted issues as a mere 15-year-old kid here. While reading through other posts discussing genuine hardships faced by individuals, a wave of insignificance washes over me—after all, we all meet the same fate eventually, so why should any of this matter? Why should I care anymore? Has anyone else found themselves devoid of tears?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

{"prompt":"I have been grappling with my suicidal thoughts for what seems like an eternity, and today I find myself at a breaking point. My depression and suicidal tendencies have not stemmed from any specific trigger; they have been a persistent presence in my life for as long as I can recall. Despite undergoing various prescribed medications, seeking help from counselors, staying physically active and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, effortlessly making friends, and continuously pushing myself to try new things in the hopes of discovering a purpose or passion in life, the weight of these thoughts has often caused me to shatter or led me to consider ending my life. These feelings have become deeply ingrained within me over time, almost defining a significant part of who I am. Initially, these thoughts terrified me, and I longed to break free from them. However, now I find myself completely detached and apathetic towards everything, including my interactions with others. The activities I once enjoyed now feel burdensome chores, devoid of any pleasure. The concept of envisioning a future filled with desires seems unimaginable as I find myself consumed by this disconnect from reality brought on by my suicidal ideations.\n\nThis sense of depersonalization has clouded my mind for the past couple of years, intensifying my lack of motivation to continue living. Although I recognize that this state of being is not conducive to my overall well-being, at this juncture, it seems like the only familiar mindset I know how to inhabit. While I am capable of maintaining decency in my interactions and responsibilities -- excelling at work and fostering meaningful relationships both platonically and romantically -- the joy or fulfillment that should accompany these accomplishments eludes me entirely. Feeling utterly drained and desensitized towards life's offerings has left me feeling utterly desolate.\n\nI am currently residing under someone else's roof following a recent hospitalization episode; the thought of clinging onto optimistic notions like \"things will get better\" offers no solace as life's challenges continue to mount without respite. Financial obligations looming overhead coupled with a profound sense of detachment from existence render the idea of ceasing to exist increasingly appealing despite harboring fear towards the physical pain such an act may entail.\n\nThe prospect of facing another painful attempt haunts me; however dire financial circumstances exacerbate this distress further - leading me down a path where there appears no alternative but to relinquish hope entirely. Amidst these turbulent emotions, even a forthcoming job interview serves merely as a means to an end--an opportunity solely directed towards acquiring funds for purchasing what I perceive as an escape route.\n\nThe persisting depersonalization leaves suicide as the only conceivable course in my state of mind; an emotional void devoid of attachment or purpose makes each passing day seem like an arduous burden rather than moments meant for enjoyment or growth.\n\nEngagement with others feels like an energy-draining feat; setting goals transforms into an exercise in futility weighed down by stressors that offer little respite from intrusive thoughts contemplating self-harm.\n\nDepression has cast its shadow over much of my existence; coupled with this newfound depersonalization phase yielding no semblance of desire or direction magnifies the sensation of being adrift amidst life’s relentless currents.\n\nFinancial constraints hinder access to less traumatic methods toward self-cessation while rendering even mundane tasks such as repairing personal belongings unattainable dreams - suffocating under mounting debts while struggling against stagnancy further compounds feelings of helplessness and entrapment within one's circumstances. The stark reality leaves me feeling utterly lost without a clear path forward.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}

Sure, I've glanced at my outward appearance like my clothes or haircut but anything deeper feels unbearable. I've projected an image of strength for so long that admitting I'm no longer that person terrifies me – leading to shutting myself off from everyone else.

It's not just about my ex not caring about me or the hurtful things she did without my knowledge. Finding that explicit video seemingly meant for me was a painful discovery. As angry as it made me, I can't entirely blame her for it. Despite the unsettling revelations about my ex-husband’s troubling behaviors, such as his interests and preferences, these issues existed before she and I parted ways. I recognize that dynamics like these happen in relationships, although everyone's experiences differ. However, this isn’t merely about my relationship woes; it’s also about a longstanding personal struggle that predates meeting her. I'm drained because fundamentally, I know right from wrong and have earnestly tried to address these issues within myself, yet they persist and worsen. Adding to the complexity is my family's inability to see beyond labeling it as fallout from my failed marriage or past relationship troubles. Although I left a note detailing why I feel this is my only recourse, even then, the whole truth wasn't conveyed to my brother by my mother. Avoiding and downplaying these critical issues won’t lead to any resolution – what I truly need is understanding and support.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" in"}

It seems like my identity is tied solely to my untapped potential for success in various endeavors that never come to fruition.

Tears are always on the brink, yet they refuse to fall, and there's no one close enough for me to confide in and truly understand the turmoil within me. Inarticulate about my emotions, it feels like there's an endless void deep within me just behind my eyes. Nothing sparks my interest anymore; life seems devoid of purpose. Anger simmers constantly within me as I grapple with past wounds that refuse to heal - nerve damage is truly tormenting. The dreams of who I wanted to become have been snatched away from me cruelly. My psyche is consumed by an overwhelming mix of sorrow, fury, and resentment that feels obscured from clear view like a distorted reflection in a foggy mirror. Despite efforts to comprehend it, all I can see are my physical flaws worsening with age before having had the chance to cherish my youth. When will this bleakness lift, and how can I mend it on my own? Suicide crosses my mind daily as an avenue for solace - a brief escape from this anguish keeping me tethered to life. A day alone in the desert with coffee sounds appealing just for respite - though thoughts of practical methods like using a gun or creating an emergency pack linger, the allure of dousing myself in gasoline and igniting it overshadows them all significantly. I feel entitled to exhibit openly the depth of pain I endure; disregard any accusations of selfishness if you perceive otherwise; all I seek is an opportunity to help myself heal gradually toward rediscovering slivers of happiness again amidst this desolation.

Despite my continuous efforts, I struggle during interviews and feel trapped in a vicious cycle of rejection.

Reflecting on my upbringing unveils a childhood marked by atypical traits. Struggling with selective mutism and retreating into the recesses of my mind were recurring themes. Immersed in inner monologues and vivid fantasies, I sought solace in books rather than socializing with peers. School felt confining and the conventional approach to education felt stifling – a sentiment that often left me feeling detached from those around me.\n\nThe roots of my struggles trace back to familial dynamics steeped in conservatism. While my older extroverted sister garnered attention due to her nature and the needs of my youngest sister demanded significant care due to her unique condition resulting from birth complications, I found myself navigating neglect within the family setting.

Unsupportive school environments compounded this by pressuring me to conform without recognizing the depth of my struggles. Traumatic incidents like being subjected to harm following a car crash only reinforced feelings of abandonment and neglect at the hands of those who were meant to protect me.\n\nMy experiences with bullying further eroded what little sense of self-worth I clung onto. This relentless cycle of abuse contributed to deteriorating mental health that eventually manifested as epilepsy – a condition exacerbated by stress-induced episodes that often landed me in hospital beds.\n\nIn the face of adversity and trauma stood my grandfather as a pillar of strength until his passing left an indelible void within me – reinforcing deep-seated fears of abandonment and loss that continue to haunt me today.\n\nTainted opportunities like having a scholarship revoked last minute due to familial restrictions imposed solely based on gender norms dealt severe blows to any aspirations for a future beyond the confines I found myself trapped in.

Approaching my 30s, I have been wrestling with depression and anxiety for an extended period, lacking motivation for work, harboring resentment towards the career path imposed on me by my family, regretting past choices, devoid of significant relationships or close friendships, devoid of aspirations or objectives. A unique eye condition impairs my vision, a matter my family struggles to comprehend. This condition renders me incapable of driving. It's likely that I have had ADHD since childhood, as evidenced by numerous symptoms then and now. However, my family staunchly believes mental illness is fictitious, equating depression and similar conditions with laziness and immaturity. My brother perceives me as lacking any sense of remorse or embarrassment for being sluggish. Ironically, my mind inundates me with feelings of guilt and shame incessantly, serving as a constant reminder that I'm trapped in misery. I harbor intense self-loathing for my past actions, current circumstances, and anticipated future blunders because I perceive myself as inherently flawed and unlikable. Even my supposed \"best friend\" distanced herself when she realized the extent of my depression as sad vibes were not to her liking. The depths of despair have driven me to contemplate self-harm through drowning, hanging, or jumping from the fourth floor of my residence building on multiple occasions - yet each time cowardice overcame intent.

My toxic family and so-called friends now view me through this lens of failure. The thought of finally having my own place, where I can have some semblance of control over my life, crosses my mind frequently. The idea of ending it all—whether by self-harm, like slitting my wrists or resorting to shooting myself, or by seeking solace in cutting to alleviate this unbearable pain—has been a recurring thought. My days seem consumed by nothing but depression, fear, regret, and an overwhelming sense of worthlessness. In my eyes, the world would not lose much if I were to no longer exist. I constantly berate myself for being such a fool and a lazy individual. The fact that I failed in my senior year only adds to this self-condemnation. It pains me to admit that I still crave love and approval from a family that is nothing but toxic, manipulative, cruel, and insincere. Sometimes I wonder why I wasn't just aborted; perhaps it would have saved me from these incessant feelings of despair. At times, it feels like I'm just counting down the moments until the end comes, ready to embrace unconsciousness and welcome the cold embrace of death all alone. It terrifies me to think that no one may find my body for months until bills pile up or worse yet—if I manage to isolate myself sufficiently—it may go unnoticed that I had passed away at all. The idea that soon nobody will even remember me fills me with an intense self-loathing. I am drowning in sorrow and yearning for help so desperately while simultaneously feeling paralyzed by fear—a fear of reaching out and a fear of being judged as weak or incompetent by others.

{"prompt":"I’m bottling everything up and it feels like I’m on the verge of breaking down. The weight of it all is becoming unbearable, to the point where I fear I might harm myself. Talking about it seems impossible – whenever I attempt to confide in someone, I only share a fraction of what I’m going through before disappearing or pretending that everything is fine. It’s puzzling why I feel at ease opening up to only one individual, unable to do so with anyone else, not even my mother. This person happens to be a well-respected figure in the community, a teacher connected to someone popular – someone I’ve known for ages. Despite having long-standing relationships with other teachers, reaching out to them is out of the question. The same goes for approaching strangers; my conversations with them invariably lead me to falsely claim that things are better now when they’re far from it. There was an instance when I confided in this teacher, maintaining a dialogue for four months before feeling overwhelmed with guilt for burdening her with my problems as she has her own life and responsibilities to attend to. Subsequently, I expressed my regret and vowed not to disturb her again – a promise I kept by withdrawing from further communication attempts. Seeking help from others has been futile as well; each time, I end up masking my true feelings and severing contact once more. Truth be told, I am not okay. It’s become apparent that suicide is looming on the horizon for me, although the timeframe remains uncertain due to my attachment to my dog preventing me from taking action immediately. Despite being disconnected from others for an extended period, they believe that all is well with me – when in reality, it couldn’t be further from the truth.

I am left without closure, still grappling with the unknown factors leading to their departure. Despite enduring physical and emotional abuse from her, I hesitated to disclose this as it felt emasculating to admit that my female partner resorted to violence during our arguments. Over the years, she urged me to seek therapy, and although I made progress in prioritizing my mental health, she seemed to resent the positive changes in me. Now, adrift in my thirties with a pervasive sense of purposelessness, stripped of both companionship and social connections that accompanied her exit. Seeking solace with family by journeying across the country only served as a stark reminder of why I distanced myself from them initially, exacerbating my already fragile mental state.\n\nI had found some semblance of peace in solitude with just my dog and the open road, shunning substances and loneliness for an extended period. Regrettably, recent events have prompted a return to heavy drinking and neglecting my prescribed medication after exhausting my supply of Ativan today – the only buffer preventing a full mental unraveling. With little hope of receiving more medication from my psychiatrist due to skepticism about its efficacy for me at this point, I feel increasingly resigned to the notion that suicide holds some twisted allure as a resolution to this suffering. Trapped by the inability to openly discuss these thoughts with therapy professionals for fear of being institutionalized against my will - an outcome I am convinced would only deepen my resolve toward self-harm.\n\nThe pervasive question lingers: why do those who profess love inflict such profound pain? It seems plausible that some form of karmic retribution has singled me out for this ordeal, conveying a bleak message from nature urging me towards demise.

Unfortunately, I have a history of childhood trauma, adult experiences of sexual assault and domestic abuse. Multiple diagnoses of CPTSD, depression, and anxiety have been part of my journey. Despite my best efforts and seeking help, the road to healing feels like an uphill battle. Adding to this complexity is the fact that I am an immigrant who considers their home country unsafe - I'm currently in the process of applying to stay in a physically secure environment but uncertainty looms until next month when a decision will be made. Daily struggles plague me with flashbacks, prolonged panic attacks, haunting nightmares, and difficulties with eating and sleeping that have persisted for far too long. I meticulously maintain a journal which reveals that over the past six months, I have had barely four hours of respite during each waking day consistently.\n\nFeeling unsafe has taken on new dimensions for me as I fear that my internal turmoil might manifest in harmful ways towards others. Since leaving an abusive relationship, I find myself unable to break the pattern of monitoring them online like a form of harassment, replicating behaviors reminiscent of how they treated me. This behavior is unacceptable and deeply troubling as despite my earnest attempts every day to occupy myself and refrain from causing distress, I repeatedly falter. The extent to which this fixation has consumed me is alarming; it's clear that it inflicts pain upon them.\n\nLooking ahead, if my bid for safety isn't granted and significant progress isn't made in addressing my mental well-being before February reaches its close, the thought of ending my life seems increasingly likely. The prospect of enduring physical jeopardy again feels unbearable alongside the reality that access to necessary treatment may also be cut off. Regrettably but with conviction, I acknowledge that as things stand now both personally and for those around me, it appears safer for all concerned if I make this decision rather than continue being a source of harm due to the multitude of demons within.\n\nIn hindsight, what pains me most is abandoning potential research ventures capable of positively impacting numerous lives on a grand scale. Recognizing my intellectual capabilities and relentless dedication to personal growth only adds weight to the sorrow felt regarding cutting short opportunities where impactful strides could've been made.\n\nI am receptive to any insights or perspectives at this juncture as I navigate this internal turmoil aware already of how broken and disruptive these feelings are without additional reminders during such trying times.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

I've come to the realization that I haven't truly looked at myself in years because the reflection staring back fills me with disgust. It's not that I haven't glimpsed at my attire or admired a fresh haircut, it's just that delving deeper is an agonizing task.

Even though my relationship with my father has improved over time, I still believe he deserves someone better than me, someone who isn't as messed up as I am.

My profoundest apologies extend not just to those around me but also to society at large for embodying what seems like an disgraceful existence.\n\nThe idea of hanging looms as an option that promises release from this agony – perhaps even painless release, if rumors can be believed. If the world despises me for all these shortcomings, know that I echo those sentiments towards myself too.\n\nI wish only to express remorse; there seems no path towards redemption or repair for someone as shattered as myself - fragmented and beyond salvageable repair - existing within damaged confines where fitting back together appears an impossible feat.\n\nThere are moments when life doesn't seem bearable anymore; in those instances where despair eclipses hope entirely - when one's damaged soul longs for ultimate peace found only through silence.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

{"prompt":"I'm a 22-year-old guy. A few days back, I was at the cash register in a gas station when an older, slightly overweight man got uncomfortably close to me in line. He was practically standing on top of me, to the point where his private parts were touching my back. Despite my attempts to move away, he persistently invaded my personal space and made physical contact. Due to my reserved and socially anxious nature, I stayed silent. Eventually, a store employee had to intervene and ask him to step back, but he still hesitated to give me some space even though there was plenty available. It seems like people target me for such behavior because I'm slender and they assume I won't stand up for myself. This isn't the first time such a thing has happened, but it might be the breaking point for me as I feel incredibly humiliated. The thought of this incident happening again pushes me towards harmful tendencies like overdosing or self-harm.\n\nIt's likely that I'll end up failing this semester yet again. There are numerous assignments that I haven't completed, with just minimal progress on two labs and two discussions which I hastily submitted right before their deadline.\n\nHowever, despite the looming possibility of failure, I won't succumb to my usual habit of disengaging from classes entirely.

The means are uncertain, though thoughts of obtaining a firearm have crossed my mind. Despite the financial necessity tied to my job, the intense distress it causes pushes me towards thoughts of self-harm. Every call at work reinforces my perception of self as a failure, and the weight of criticism is unbearable. Ending it all seems like admitting defeat, but perhaps in death, there might be solace. If I were gone, he wouldn't have to worry about our survival single-handedly. Revealing how this job is affecting me to him today only brought disillusionment instead of understanding or comfort that I sought desperately.

Despite resolving the issues that once drove me towards thoughts of self-harm, I find myself plagued by the overwhelming sense of life's futility. For an entire year, my mind fixated on the insignificance of life after death and how ultimately trivial our existence is. Even though there are no specific hardships pushing me towards suicidal thoughts now, I am haunted by a persistent urge to end it all.

{"prompt":"All I yearn for is to lead a typical life. I often wish I had been born without ADHD. Unfortunately, it has been a constant companion since childhood despite being told it would fade with puberty. Instead, the symptoms have worsened considerably. It has transformed me into the stereotype of perpetual distraction and laziness depicted in media. Everything feels like a monumental effort unless it captures my intense focus. Social interactions have become challenging, making me feel like an outsider in my own skin. The accusatory remarks made about me in the past held some truth—I did exhibit inappropriate behavior fueled by my fixation on anime and its questionable content. Consequently, I've been unfairly labeled as odd and faced relentless bullying, especially during middle school when thoughts of death first crossed my mind. The fear of losing connections with people terrifies me deeply, as I struggle to maintain relationships due to my tendency to speak impulsively and without filters.\n\nDespite being handed every advantage - being white, male, attending private school, having affluent parents, and receiving a full scholarship for college -  I have squandered it all. My academic pursuits resulted in obtaining two seemingly worthless degrees that offer no promising career opportunities. Even when provided a job at my mother's workplace to keep me occupied, my tenure was short-lived as I was let go for revealing suicidal tendencies during the probation period.\n\nLoneliness looms heavily over me as feelings of inadequacy intensify. In particular, interacting with women evokes fear as I am haunted by my appearance and lack of social grace which undermines any potential for meaningful connections. Each relationship I venture into quickly crumbles, compounding my despair.\n\nTherapy has provided little solace while medication dulls any fleeting moments of pleasure I experience from simple indulgences. The overwhelming desire to end this suffering lingers persistently in my mind. The burden I impose on others gnaws at me relentlessly – prompting thoughts on how best to exit this world without causing additional pain to those who care about me.\n\nThe prospect of carrying on in this manner seems insurmountable; the notion of finding normalcy appears beyond reach. What purpose does life serve when one struggles immensely just to carry their own weight? Ending this torment seems like the only respite from the pervasive darkness that engulfs me each day - offering a semblance of peace that eludes me in life's complexities.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

The cycle of despair continues tonight with overwhelming anxiety and depression.

{"prompt":"A brief lengthy tale. Greetings, everyone. The shadow of depression has loomed over me for as long as I can remember, dating back to my days in 2nd grade, and over time, its grip has only tightened. At 19, my existence feels like a relentless storm of misfortune. My parents are no longer with me – my mother passed away nearly four years ago, and my father a year before that due to a tragic accident. Despite the hardships I endured at the hands of my mother, who struggled with her own battles with mental health, I hold no bitterness towards her. Abruptly estranged from my father during my early teens, their absence is keenly felt every day.\n\nMy initial brush with suicide involved a desperate attempt with a phone charger when I couldn't find any rope nearby—an act spurred by overwhelming hopelessness. Though at one point I resolved to join the military and meet my end in combat, a shift occurred when I moved in with my aunt and uncle. For a while, things seemed to improve; I excelled in school and received praise for inner strength from friends and family who assured me of their unwavering support. Still, I couldn't shake the feeling that every accomplishment was merely a reflection of their kindness rather than stemming from within.\n\nHigh school graduation and college acceptance were milestones attained through their relentless encouragement; however, once college life commenced, everything crumbled at an alarming pace. My academic performance plummeted drastically; the safety net of support vanished as reality hit hard. My job now hangs by a thread amid mounting struggles to keep up with coursework after missing classes and assignments.\n\nMultiple suicide attempts mark chapters of intense pain battled by thoughts of loved ones bearing the burden of such loss. Each passing day weighs heavier than the last; recently, facing arrest on felony charges related to possession rivets me further into despair. Spent nights in confinement serve as grim reminders of spiraling circumstances with limited avenues for recourse.\n\nConcealing emotions becomes second nature; fabricating responses to inquiries about well-being chip away at mental fortitude inexorably draining resilience. The allure of self-inflicted demise lingers as an illusory solution to alleviate suffering brought upon those closest to me—at least that's what it seems in moments shadowed by guilt and regret.\n\nDeparting for campus living appears to have eased tensions within my aunt and uncle's household – perhaps hinting at relief in being removed from the equation. Recent searches on methods disguising self-harm point towards tragic accidents as preferred alternatives over direct confrontation but resources remain limited aside from crisis hotlines.\n\nStricken by phone anxiety deterring traditional avenues for reaching out—preferring virtual confessions over real-time dialogues accentuates reluctance towards personal interactions amidst mounting distress.I appreciate your attention given to this candid sharing resembling a 'Ted Talk'; any lapses in grammar or punctuation are regrettable yet secondary amidst inner turmoil spilling onto this digital canvas.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}

It all started during a visit to a friend's lake house back in April when I had a fall from a tire swing barely 2 feet off the ground, landing flat on my back. Initially, I didn't notice any significant changes except feeling sick and fatigued that night but no major symptoms. Two days later, back home, things seemed a bit off with a foggy sensation in my head. After about a week passed, upon consulting my regular doctor, the diagnosis was swift – a concussion. However, as my symptoms persisted unchanged, I was later told by a neurologist that it could be post-concussion syndrome despite not displaying the typical signs of a concussion besides the mental haze.\n\nIn search of relief, I turned to a chiropractor which unfortunately didn't yield any improvement. Towards the end of summer, in an attempt to unwind, I spent much time golfing but found no solace there either. Soon after, things took a turn for the worse; the fogginess in my head escalated into an uncomfortable sensation akin to hot water swirling inside it. Desperate for help, I consulted a naturopathic doctor specializing in natural remedies who expressed confidence in treating all my symptoms. In addition to undergoing multiple scans on my back and neck areas along with seeing various medical professionals including specialists at concussion clinics without much success.\n\nAt one point, following my mother's suggestion, I tried CBD oil which unfortunately exacerbated my condition causing severe inflammation in my head. Subsequently seeking advice from another naturopathic doctor led me down the path of visiting several vision specialists but no alarming issues were identified. Further investigations like neurotransmitter testing hinted at anxiety being at play and thus Cymbalta was prescribed progressively from 30 - 60 - 30 MG without notable relief.\n\nFeeling increasingly despondent as nothing seemed to alleviate my suffering despite trying various treatments such as vitamin D supplements for low levels indicated in testing and addressing abnormally high cortisol levels associated with extreme stress markers. The array of symptoms includes facial tightness, stiff neck, constricted temples along with unusual sensations like warm water movements and zapping feelings around my head and temples while aggravating factors include pressure against surfaces worsening symptoms especially itchiness around eyes or sitting down.\n\nThe most distressing symptom remains an intense heat and swelling sensation within my head along with perceived movement adding to discomfort; however oddly enough finding some respite outdoors in extreme cold conditions like snow or taking cold showers albeit briefly before symptoms resurface again is noteworthy but fleeting.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" in"}

My self-worth feels non-existent; I'm convinced that I'm utterly worthless and only good for running errands. It's disheartening that being true to myself as a trans individual even seems like a flaw. The only solace I find is in the thought of punishing myself through starvation, although it's not as immediate or final as the alternatives of hanging or firearms. The idea of reuniting with my departed father in heaven feels like the only consolation amidst feeling neglected by those who were supposed to offer support. Faced with indifference and dejection from every corner, it's becoming increasingly tempting to expedite my own demise rather than continue feeling like a burden and an utter failure in every aspect of life.

Initially, there wasn't any noticeable change post-accident, but later that night I started feeling unwell and fatigued though not displaying any major symptoms. Upon returning home two days later, I began feeling slightly off with a persistent foggy sensation in my head. After roughly a week, my regular doctor diagnosed it as a concussion without the typical accompanying symptoms except for the persistent fogginess.\n\nFollowing this, a neurologist labeled it as post-concussion syndrome even in the absence of traditional concussion symptoms. Despite seeking help from a chiropractor which didn't yield results, and attempting to relax through frequent golfing towards the end of summer, things took a turn for the worse. My head became more than just foggy; it felt as though there was heat trapped inside, causing extreme discomfort. Turning to a naturopathic doctor specializing in natural remedies for relief, subsequent tests including MRI scans, x-rays, and CT scans were conducted on various areas like my back and neck with no significant findings.\n\nFurther visits to a concussion clinic proved futile prompting experimentation with CBD oil on my mother's suggestion which unfortunately aggravated my condition leading to heightened inflammation in my head. Subsequent consultations with vision specialists at the recommendation of the naturopathic doctor didn't reveal any concerning issues either resulting in additional tests like neurotransmitter assessments pointing towards anxiety as a potential underlying factor.\n\nThe introduction of Cymbalta prescribed to manage possible anxiety hasn’t shown significant improvements despite adjustments in dosage from 30mg to 60mg down to 30mg again. Feeling increasingly disheartened as nothing seems to alleviate my symptoms even after trying various interventions suggested by healthcare providers including supplementing with vitamin D due to low levels and addressing elevated cortisol levels signifying high stress levels akin to being chased persistently by something intense.\n\nSymptoms persist such as tightness in facial muscles, stiffness in the neck area, tension around temples accompanied by sensations akin to hot water flowing and zapping feelings around my head and temples.

Itching sensations within the head particularly along with unsettling movements experienced mostly at the middle of my back when pressed against something.\n\nThe most distressing symptom remains the sensation of extreme heat and inflammation engulfing my head coupled with involuntary movements observed within it.

The disdain I hold extends to them and my parents; all I desire is to vanish into oblivion. Though reluctant to entertain their sympathy or give them the satisfaction of knowing their impact on me, the urge to escape to a remote forest and fade away intensifies.\n\nThe sole flicker of hope keeping me from taking drastic action is the slim possibility of securing admission into a distant college with a full scholarship—a chance for a fresh start without any reminders of my tormented past existence. However, given the minuscule odds of this occurring, uncertainty clouds my mind relentlessly.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}
{"prompt":"I have moments when I wish everything would just end and harbor resentment towards my parents. It confuses me why these feelings linger when objectively my life seems fine. I reside with my parents who generously provide for me financially, offering a comfortable home and fulfilling many of my desires. Furthermore, I have a strong affection for our two dogs, making the thought of leaving them behind deeply distressing. Despite struggling with my academic performance in college with graduation still two years away, giving me hope for independence once I secure a job post-graduation. Although I cherish my parents and acknowledge their overwhelming love, their tendency to erupt in anger over trivial matters leaves me emotionally depleted. The unpredictable nature of their outbursts, often unrelated to academic struggles but instead fixating on minor issues like stray hairs on the floor, hints at potential underlying issues such as possible OCD in my mom. While conscious of their deep affection for me, their persistent yelling feels incessant and beyond their control. It seems like the only way to potentially reduce these episodes is by achieving perfection: flawless grades, immaculate room maintenance, and increased contributions to household chores. Despite recognizing that this may not entirely eliminate the problem, it might alleviate it to some extent. However, summoning the motivation to meet these expectations feels overwhelmingly challenging – some days even getting out of bed before noon seems like an insurmountable task. This sense of inadequacy weighs heavily on me; acknowledging that I falter in exercising self-discipline exacerbates my existing anxiety and depression. My reliance on medications like Adderall and Paxil has provided some relief by facilitating communication with others and enabling me to manage my coursework effectively; yet every so often, a wave of despair engulfs me, leaving me feeling disconnected from God's presence despite my faith in Him.

I acknowledge that this may seem like a trivial question, and I can't shake the feeling of guilt for bringing it up when I know that countless others are facing much greater challenges. However, amidst this moment of mental clarity, I feel compelled to express that I have been grappling with suicidal thoughts over an extended period. My anxiety and depression appear to be intensifying with each passing day, causing these thoughts to consume me for the past few months. While I am aware that divulging such feelings to certain individuals, like some friends and my father, could potentially burden them further as they have already endured significant losses, making me wish at times that our paths had never crossed out of fear of causing more pain, the weight of these thoughts continues to grow daily. Despite lacking concrete and reliable plans at present, the impulsive nature of my actions during dark periods is something I am all too familiar with. One ray of light in this darkness is a supportive long-distance friend who has shown great empathy without judgment or criticism towards me. Lately, they have witnessed firsthand the depths of my anxiety-ridden and self-destructive tendencies. Contemplating whether to disclose the extent to which thoughts surrounding self-harm have occupied my mind lately is a constant internal debate. The last thing I want is to burden them with my struggles any further, given that it feels like I am already overwhelming them with my problems.

I find myself with minimal possessions, lacking both professional attire and emotional fulfillment. Each day seems to blend together as I struggle to find purpose or joy, while plagued by persistent nightmares and a sense of isolation.\n\nMy financial struggles have left me dependent on others for shelter, adding to my sense of worthlessness and resentment towards my current living situation. The recent experience of an abortion has only added to the weight of despair I carry, as feelings of emptiness and self-loathing consume me. Physical changes such as aging, weight gain, and a lack of self-care have further fueled my self-hatred and alienation from those around me.\n\nThe prospect of facing a bleak future with no prospects for improvement has led me to contemplate drastic measures as a means of escape. Overwhelmed by feelings of hopelessness and unrelenting pain, I am consumed by thoughts of self-harm. Despite witnessing others with more advantages succumb to such despair, I struggle to find the resolve to act on my thoughts.\n\nEach passing moment feels like an eternity as I grapple with the desire for release from this unbearable suffering. Despite having achieved academic success, I now find myself drowning in failure and disillusionment, with no accomplishments worthy of recognition or remembrance.\n\nThe thought of another day ahead fills me with disgust as I continue to be tormented by feelings of resentment towards those closest to me and the harsh realities that surround me.

One particular attempt stands out where I was rescued by an individual who had taken their own life a couple of years ago. It's a strange mix of feelings – jealousy and intense anger towards them. The belief in \"my body, my choice\" should extend to being able to make the decision to end my own life. The current system that forbids this choice and instead leaves one to suffer is utterly disappointing. What's even more disheartening is how this mindset seems to spread to those around me. Despite being on medication, my major depressive disorder seems resistant to treatment. The rare moments of happiness I've experienced in recent years have been when I indulge in altering my perception of reality, if only momentarily shielding myself from the relentless 24\/7 intrusive thoughts.

The weight of feeling like a burden on others due to circumstances beyond my control is overwhelming, as is accepting blame for situations where it may not entirely be my fault. Relying on intoxication as my sole source of joy is disheartening. Dealing with an emotionally abusive mother who shifts blame onto me for her own issues or shows anger towards me during panic attacks only adds to the pain. It's hard to find solace when those who claim they care about me seem insincere or absent when I truly need support. My inner turmoil has become unbearable, and despite trying various coping mechanisms, I feel like giving up is becoming a viable option.

{"prompt":"My struggles seem to be escalating, and the idea of ending my life lingers constantly, yet I am unable to take that step. Each day feels like an uphill battle against my escalating issues. The emotional neglect from my parents haunts me, driving me to seek the love and attention I yearned for but never received. This longing dictates every aspect of my existence. It often stems from witnessing others receive praise, triggering thoughts that I must achieve or possess those things to be worthy of love. Even simple things like observing a drawing intensify my despair. Seeking professional help is not an option as my mom disapproves of any display of sadness on my part. The mere mention of mental health is met with anger and harsh reprimands from her, instilling fear in me. I can't shake off the feeling of insignificance; convinced that others facing more severe struggles are more deserving of care than me. Listening to others talk about their problems evokes a mix of sorrow and envy within me, as they receive the affection I long for but may never have.

Yet, I recently attempted some artwork only to feel drained and defeated when it didn't turn out well. There was a time when I found joy in creating things, in experimenting, and in investing time because it held value for me. However, the influences of capitalism and the need for immediate gratification have severely messed with my mind. This wasn't what I anticipated for myself, but here I am. I'm lost regarding my aspirations and uncertain about the kind of future that awaits me. Nothing seems clear anymore. I yearn for a way out of this darkness soon, but there's also the possibility that it might not happen. That's just another facet of life too.

Despite having a job that pays well, owning a car, and even successfully acquiring a house with a mortgage that I can manage on my own, I can't help but question the purpose of it all. Living feels like a burden that I despise. Finding joy in anything seems like an impossible task.\n\nMy struggle with obesity traces back to when I was just 6 years old, and I am fully aware that it lies at the core of my issues. So why do I continue to fail at addressing it? Each time I make progress in losing weight, I eventually give up before reaching my goal, only to find myself nearly 300 pounds again seemingly overnight. This vicious cycle has repeated itself numerous times, leaving me frustrated and questioning why I can't commit to seeing it through. How did I manage to waste the best years of my life being overweight and feeling like a complete failure?\n\nDespite lacking confidence and struggling with weight issues, I have been in relationships. However, looking back now, those relationships seem to have caused more harm than good. Even after 6 years since dating one particular girl and not seeing her for the past 3 years despite remaining friends, I find myself still hung up on her. It makes me feel like an overweight, foolish person who just can't move on.

It seems like being a good friend, child, grandchild, role model, student, or even excelling in hobbies like gaming or art is beyond my reach. I can't seem to shake off the feeling of being utterly useless except for running errands. The struggle of not fitting the conventional expectations due to being transgender adds another layer of despair. Lately, I've resorted to starving myself as a slow escape, contemplating even faster methods like hanging or having access to a gun for a quick and painless exit, longing to reunite with my late father in some form of afterlife. The support that used to be there has also faded away; feeling like a burden is overwhelming. If death comes sooner through starvation, it almost feels like a relief at this point.

It is disheartening to feel this overwhelming sense of melancholy even during these seemingly positive moments, especially knowing they are fleeting.

I experienced sexual assault and the lack of support from my family is intensifying my sense of vulnerability and triggering past trauma. The overwhelming emotions are suffocating me to the point where I can't bear it any longer. The desire to escape is consuming me, but I fear that this torment will persist for a considerable amount of time. Being required to stay with them until January 19th adds to the feeling of entrapment and hopelessness. Despite my attempts to rescue myself, it seems impossible without external intervention. The situation I find myself in, with a mother consumed by religious fanaticism focused solely on my autistic sister, only amplifies my sense of helplessness and despair. \n\nFurthermore, there are additional layers of distress stemming from past traumas within my family dynamic. My needs have always been disregarded, evident when my mother pressured me into buying a car while working a low-paying job and struggling with car insurance payments after being involved in multiple accidents - all while my sister received indulgence without pursuing higher education or sustainable employment. This sacrifice of my well-being for the sake of others underscores the disregard for my feelings and experiences within my family unit. Even when facing traumatic episodes like surviving meningitis and losing my right ear while conscious, I am met with dismissive responses from my mother that undermine the gravity of these experiences.\n\nIncessant emotional manipulation within the family setting has deeply scarred me, exacerbated by unsettling dynamics such as ignoring instances of abuse and enabling toxic behavior at the expense of my well-being. The accumulation of such distressing events has left me feeling utterly depleted and hopeless. \n\nAdditionally, navigating through an academic environment saturated with extreme leftist ideology has further isolated me due to my moderate inclinations, resulting in a recurring theme where blame is unjustly assigned based on social categories rather than individual accountability. This predicament accentuates feelings of alienation and disconnect as I struggle to relate to younger peers engulfed in this polarizing worldview.\n\nReflecting on lost opportunities compounded by family decisions that derailed prospects for higher education intensifies feelings of regret and resentment towards past choices made out of loyalty but yielding immense personal sacrifices.\n\nOverall, the continuous cycle of trauma, emotional neglect, and societal disillusionment has left me grappling with profound despair and longing for a sense of liberation from this relentless turmoil.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

Depression has taken a severe toll on me recently, and it's not unfamiliar territory as I've grappled with it throughout my existence. The weight of guilt from my past decisions and mistakes burdens me every single day, making me feel like a terrible person. My emotional instability and anxiety have caused me to ruin almost all my potential relationships, leaving me in a cycle of self-blame and regret. Reflecting on my past actions fills me with immense shame, especially knowing that I've lost many friends over the past year. Graduating college has only made it more challenging to maintain connections, particularly since unemployment has confined me to my home as I try to figure out my next steps.\n\nIsolation has become second nature to me due to the overwhelming shame and depression that consume me because of the reasons mentioned earlier.

Over the past two years, since returning to my homeland of Romania, I have been weighed down by an overwhelming amount of stress, primarily stemming from school in 2019. I found myself lacking in friends and routinely spent nights in tears, even activities that once brought me joy felt dull. The idea of ending my own life crossed my mind numerous times, but each time, thoughts of my little brother flooded in – he is my everything and the sole anchor keeping me here. Amidst the pandemic, things somewhat improved; though anxiety still loomed large, having a supportive friend who lent an ear made a significant difference. However, lately, things have taken a severe downturn. I am being consumed by stress and anxiety to the point where even simple tasks seem insurmountable. Furthermore, last year I came to terms with being atheist and bisexual, which starkly contrasts with my deeply religious family and friends. Having recently confided in my only friend about this, he has since distanced himself from me; he was my confidant and the only source of comfort I had regular contact with. With all these emotions bottled up inside me, expressing them to those close to me seems impossible as they are likely to dismiss my feelings as mere phases or trivialize them due to my age.

The intensity escalated when I entered university – lacking friends, burdened by social anxiety, lack of drive exacerbated by depression resulted in me isolating myself completely.

Subsequently, I turned to drugs, relentlessly chasing after that initial high from various substances. Experimenting extensively and dabbling in everything except opiates, along with frequent hallucinogenic trips combined with nitrous oxide\/balloons severely impacted my mental well-being. The consumption of LSD on three separate occasions further destabilized my mental state. Following some trips, I made half-hearted suicide attempts without requiring hospitalization at any point.

I reside with my parents who have the means to provide for me comfortably. Our home is pleasant and I have the luxury of acquiring things that bring me joy. I share a deep connection with my two beloved dogs, making the thought of leaving them behind a source of worry for me. Despite being enrolled in college (albeit struggling), with a graduation date set in two years, providing hope for future independence by obtaining a job and moving out, there are times when I can't help but feel animosity towards my parents. Despite knowing that I care for them deeply and would make sacrifices for their well-being, their tendencies to erupt into fits of anger over trivial matters leave me emotionally drained. The unpredictability of their outbursts leaves me on edge; they may not harp on poor academic performance but will lash out if a single stray hair is found on the floor. I suspect my mother may be battling with OCD, further complicating our living dynamics. While there is no doubt in my mind about their love for me, the relentless yelling persists unabated. It feels as though the only way to potentially lessen these episodes is if I were flawless - achieving top grades, maintaining impeccable cleanliness in my living space, and contributing more to household chores. Perhaps then, while still likely to reprimand me at times, their anger would be less frequent. However, summoning the energy to meet these impossibly high standards proves daunting; some days even getting out of bed before noon feels like an insurmountable task. A sense of inadequacy looms over me, accentuated by struggles with self-discipline compounded by anxiety and depression. Though taking Adderall and Paxil has been beneficial in managing these conditions - allowing me to engage with others without fear and fulfill my academic responsibilities - there are moments where everything still feels overwhelming.

Typically, I would engage in activities like painting, setting small daily goals, and ensuring social interactions by being in public. Unfortunately, these options are currently out of reach for me, exacerbating my downward spiral.\n\nWhile I believe I am not an immediate danger to myself, I fear that this could change rapidly. Despite reaching out to friends and family for support, their responses have been disheartening. My sister dismissed my venting as mere complaints and urged me to focus on actionable solutions rather than dwelling on things beyond my control. Similarly, my parents advised me to concentrate on the positive aspects of life.\n\nThe main reason I have refrained from seeking medical attention is the absence of insurance until the beginning of next month alongside starting a new part-time teaching job recently. Abruptly leaving without explanation would only create complications for the staff, and continuing under such circumstances would make it challenging to resume teaching after a sudden absence.\n\nThe dilemma I face is whether to tough it out until the 1st or seek assistance now despite financial concerns and potential professional repercussions.

{"prompt":"I'm struggling. There's a looming final test that seems to hold my fate until October. Surprisingly, I find myself not wishing for my demise this time around. It's not that I am eager to stay alive either, but there are commitments on my plate. I'm currently in the midst of orchestrating a move and the last thing I want is to invest financially only to meet my end shortly after. However, if I fail this test, I don't think I can continue. The window of opportunity has closed, I can't access my medications, there's no suitable place to contemplate jumping from, and the blades I used for harm don't seem effective enough. Strangely, it feels like a rare moment of contentment in my life. Engrossed in setting up my new room and envisioning where all my projects will go, a surge of thoughts floods my mind with ideas (perhaps fueled by fleeting euphoria). It's as though a sense of purpose is emerging. Things are relatively stable now, and I'm eager to keep moving forward with my plans. Uncertain about when I'll have access to antidepressants again, but despite it all, there's a slight improvement in how I feel.

{"prompt":"I am currently going through a lot of pain and it feels like there's no light at the end of the tunnel. Growing up in an abusive environment has left me feeling unloved and neglected by my parents. While my relationship with my sister has improved slightly, I still find myself in a world of emotional agony. I strongly suspect that I am dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder due to the abuse I've endured, coupled with a constant state of anxiety. Physical health issues have also surfaced, which my therapist attributes to my anxiety levels. The overwhelming sensation of loneliness and insignificance looms over me, making me believe that love is something I may never experience and that I am simply a burden on this earth.\n\nAs tears stream down my face while writing this, all I long for is companionship – not necessarily romantic, just someone to be there as I navigate life and age alongside them. Yet, people either flee upon witnessing my vulnerabilities or take advantage of them, forcing me to sever ties. This perpetual cycle of abandonment leaves me questioning why I am destined to be forsaken. Although leaning on my faith offers some solace now, it used to be a source of pure anguish before that.\n\nEven during moments of leisure like playing games or diving into books, my body is constantly wracked with tension and pain. Finding someone willing to listen without monetary compensation is near impossible. My therapist stands out as a rare exception – she listens without judgment but for a fee, highlighting the extent of my isolation. Despite her advice to stay present in the moment, being mindful often plunges me into a deep abyss.\n\nEver since enduring abuse at the hands of my father, I have felt like an outcast and fear this label will permanently define me. What I truly crave is love – warm embraces, affirmations of worthiness, reassurances that everything will eventually fall into place; yet these seem out of reach. At this very moment, I am barely holding on by a thread and trying desperately to rediscover joy in simple pleasures similar to those from childhood.\n\nHowever, every time I confront my inner demons head-on, they mercilessly attempt to overpower me. It sometimes feels as though my existence carries no weight in this world; existing solely as a fading memory in the minds of those who once knew me. Despite all this suffering and despair, what anchors me to the present is the smallest glimmer of self-worth amidst ceaseless torment.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" in"}

Despite his exceptional kindness, intelligence, and bright potential, his past traumas have cast a shadow over his life. Witnessing his gradual healing process fills me with a deep sense of sorrow for all he has endured. He is truly deserving of a far better life than the one fate has dealt him. If only there was a way for me to offer my life to grant him the happiness he deserves. While I may not see value in my own existence, he is someone who unquestionably does.

The methods no longer matter to me; all that counts is achieving the end result.\n\nCrashing onto the ground or leaping from a bridge into the water seems strangely calming. If only I could hit my head on a rock during the fall. \n\nThe mornings are the hardest – waking up serves as a cruel reminder that I am still here, facing another day filled with internal torment.\n\nPerhaps today will be when it all comes to an end. Although heights used to terrify me, the idea of plummeting from a tall building now holds a certain appeal. A swift impact with the concrete below would bring an end to everything.\n\nI am deeply troubled in my thoughts and actions. To those who know me, I apologize if my behavior has seemed strange or erratic. \n\nI am more broken than anyone can comprehend.

Whether by hanging myself or crashing my car, the method hardly matters anymore.\n\nDeath seems impartial; it does not discriminate based on circumstances or feelings.\n\nA secluded spot, a bottle of pills swallowed down – embarking on one final journey before succumbing somewhere unseen.\n\nAs long as my intentions remain clear and decisive, carrying out these plans should unfold seamlessly.\n\nThe allure of death entices me; disappearing from this world would relieve everyone of my burdensome presence.\n\nAmidst these contemplations looms uncertainty whether I will truly act upon them. Only time will reveal when I will meet my demise; every morning brings with it regret for waking up again.\n\nYearning that I had ended it all earlier, perhaps pulling the metaphorical plug before reaching this point.\n\nThe day seems idyllic – fitting for contemplating self-erasure. Despite research into more efficient means like cyanide poisoning, simpler methods appear tempting in their affordability and accessibility.\n\nA noose seems straightforward and cost-effective; convenient locations within reach further fuel these dark considerations.\n\nMastering the art of tying a precise noose carries an odd sense of accomplishment amidst such dire thoughts of self-harm,\n\nThe concept of turning it into a challenge adds a twisted element – potentially being the only competition where victory equates to finality . \n\nIt feels like the most viable option at present; by the time others take notice, it will be far too late — I'll have vanished completely from this realm.\n\n\nDespite how long I sleep, each awakening fills me with longing for cessation - dangling from a rope begins to hold an appeal simply because its finality brings solace.\n\n\n\nIf only stature didn't generate obstacles in carrying out such desires - locating a sufficiently tall spot becomes imperative for success-driven determination .\n\nReturning to sleep becomes an appealing escape from these tumultuous thoughts plaguing me endlessly.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

{"prompt":"Seeking help. It has now been a full month since my partner, whom I shared a decade-long relationship with, unceremoniously left me on my birthday. Abruptly, they packed their bags and declared their departure. The lack of closure is overwhelming, as I remain clueless about what transpired. Enduring both physical and emotional abuse from her, I grappled with the difficulty of disclosing such experiences due to societal perceptions of masculinity. How does one admit that their female partner resorts to violence during arguments at home? For years, she implored me to undergo therapy and finally commenced sessions during the pandemic. I invested significant effort in self-improvement and mental well-being, only for her to resent this transformed version of me. Now in my thirties, adrift without purpose, she departed taking all our mutual friends along. Seeking solace with family by relocating across the country only served to exacerbate my mental anguish, reminding me why I distanced myself from them initially. Paradoxically, solitude with just my canine companion in the confines of my car felt more fulfilling. Desisting from my prescribed medication and resorting to heavy drinking – a pattern that had been dormant for almost a year – I consumed my final Ativan today, its presence being the thin barrier against despair for me. Foreseeing reluctance from my psychiatrist to renew the prescription, the notion of finality looms large. Perhaps for certain individuals, suicide becomes an unavoidable destiny; a concept I am gradually coming to terms with. Yet articulating these sentiments candidly with my therapist or psychiatrist seems unfeasible as fear of institutionalization looms large. Understanding myself well enough to predict that even within such confines I would feign recovery merely to escape further drives me closer towards self-harm. The question persists: why do individuals presumed to harbor love for us inflict such profound pain? Could it be that misfortune shadowing me is a manifestation of past misdeeds deserving retribution? Nature's subtle indications seem to point towards an inevitable demise as an act of cosmic balancing. This outpouring seeks no response or acknowledgment; it stems purely from a place of deep-seated isolation.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

However, since completing rehab, my fascination with self-help literature has grown significantly. It seems there's always one book that I'm engrossed in. It feels like I'm grieving for myself. At times, it's as if I'm mourning the version of myself that never fully emerged.\n\nI’ve recently started taking mood stabilizers and gradually increased the dosage to a level where I've started noticing a consistent difference. While there's uncertainty about whether this effect will endure as I continue to up the dosage, I remain hopeful. Although I'm still grappling with intense depression, my recent thought patterns have shown some positive shifts.\n\nDuring a brief phase of stability lasting approximately a month, I experienced a sense of self-assurance and confidence that had previously eluded me.

The realization that so much time may have been lost fills me with profound sadness. Depression continues to loom large, consuming about 80% of my day with tears or teetering on the edge of despair.

{"prompt":"I don't understand what's happening to me. It all started about 7 months ago when I was 17. During a visit to a friend's lake house in April, I had a fall from a tire swing that was barely two feet off the ground. At first, there didn't seem to be any major issues, but that night I began feeling unwell and fatigued, though my symptoms weren't severe. Two days later, back at home, I started feeling a bit off with a foggy and fuzzy sensation in my head. After about a week, my regular doctor diagnosed it as a concussion due to the persistent symptoms. A neurologist later identified it as post-concussion syndrome, even though I didn't exhibit the typical concussion signs apart from the fogginess.\n\nDespite seeking help from various healthcare professionals like a chiropractor, naturopathic doctor specializing in natural medicine, and undergoing multiple tests like MRIs and CT scans on my back and neck, the symptoms persisted and even intensified over time. Attempts at relaxation through golfing proved futile as my head started feeling like it was filled with hot water causing extreme discomfort.\n\nTo address this ongoing ordeal, I turned to CBD oil on my mother's recommendation but unfortunately experienced increased inflammation in my head instead of relief. Following another naturopathic doctor's advice led me to consultations with vision specialists and eventually trying Cymbalta for what he suggested might be anxiety-driven symptoms. Despite varying dosages of Cymbalta from 30mg to 60mg back down to 30mg again, there has been no respite.\n\nFeeling increasingly despondent as nothing seems to alleviate my condition despite efforts that also included vitamin D supplementation for low levels and dealing with elevated cortisol levels which were likened by the doctor to being chased by something intense. The range of symptoms is vast - from tightening sensations in the face, neck stiffness, temples constricting, to feelings of hot water flowing and zapping around my head and temples.\n\nThe continuous discomfort aggravates when I rest my head against surfaces; triggering itching around my eyes and causing further movement within the head and back regions. The most distressing symptom remains the intense heat and inflammation inside my head that seems to constantly shift positions.\n\nStrangely enough, some relief is found outdoors in extreme cold such as snow or cold showers provide temporary comfort until the symptoms resurface again relentlessly leaving me feeling lost and helpless against this inexplicable ordeal.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" in"}

I can't seem to excel in any of my hobbies or interests – whether it's fighting games, racing games, or art. It's as though I have no real purpose except maybe running errands for others. The fact that I'm transgender only adds to my feelings of inadequacy. I've even resorted to self-starvation as a way to escape this overwhelming pain, although the thought of ending things quickly with a gun feels like a more appealing option for me – it seems like a faster, less painful, and more definitive solution.

{"prompt":"I yearn to lead a normal life. If only I hadn't been born with ADHD. From childhood to adolescence, they told me it would fade away with puberty, but that was far from true. It not only persisted but worsened, gradually morphing me into the stereotype of someone lazily daydreaming and endlessly distracted that you often see portrayed on TV. Simple tasks no longer hold my interest unless they captivate me intensely, almost bordering on obsession where I can recite details from a Wikipedia page verbatim. This shift eroded my ability to connect socially and behave like an average person. Back then, the accusations against me rang true. I did indeed exhibit inappropriate behavior like trying to peek up girls' skirts - mimicking what I had seen in anime, an intense passion of mine at the time. Consequently, I've always felt like an outcast - odd and unstable - inviting ridicule especially during my relentless bullying in middle school. It was during this period that I first found myself screaming about wanting to end it all, a sentiment that has lingered in my mind ever since.\n\nI harbor a deep-seated fear of losing people rather than meeting them. As my best friend put it bluntly: \"I tolerate him.\" My interactions are marked by awkward comments devoid of context that only make sense to me, unwittingly causing offense with my thoughtless words. I vividly recall my mother once blaming me for any potential divorce between her and dad - a prophecy that eventually came true; such is the pattern of blame that always lands on me. The most disheartening aspect is that theoretically, I possessed every possible advantage - being white, male, attending a prestigious private school with affluent parents who fully funded my college education without burdening me with debts. Yet, despite these privileges, everything slipped through my fingers.\n\nAlas, I obtained two seemingly worthless degrees which offer no promising career paths. Even after securing a job courtesy of my mother's connections at her office to keep me occupied and out of trouble, I failed miserably when I got fired during the probationary period due to my suicidal tendencies being revealed.\n\nAbove all else, loneliness consumes me as society labels me as an outsider who craves something unattainable solely based on meritocracy. Women especially intimidate me as I bitterly recognize myself as a short and unattractive individual lacking in prospects and interpersonal finesse. Each short-lived relationship disintegrates within weeks leaving behind shattered remnants.\n\nTherapy proved futile while medication steals away the minuscule moments of joy left in my life — even those provided by simple pleasures like physical touch or self-soothing measures akin to stroking hairy palms for comfort.\n\nDesperately seeking release from this unending pain and burden on others’ lives is paramount now; seeking solace in the idea of fading away invisibly without leaving behind any remnants for grieving parents seems like the only solution left.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

Dealing with the monthly struggles unique to women only adds to the burden. The constant chaos of arguments and shouts has drained me completely. The sounds of dogs yelping in agony after being abused physically are unbearable. I am weary of clinging to a false sense of safety around me; everything feels unreal, as though it never held any truth for me from the start. I feel stuck, incapable of finding a release or a solution for the ongoing torment around me and within me. Dark thoughts haunt me relentlessly - the desire to harm others, the twisted craving for the adrenaline rush that stabbing someone might bring, even wishing for dreadful experiences like sexual assault just to feel validated in my own suffering. There's a lingering suspicion that perhaps such traumas have touched my life before, buried in forgotten memories.\n\nI'm not seeking attention or pity; I just long to feel acknowledged in my pain. I downplay my own trauma, believing it isn't severe enough to warrant attention or support; perhaps if it were more pronounced, I would exhibit symptoms like Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) or Bipolar Disorder.

This mental anguish has driven me into this dark place within my mind where self-loathing festers.\n\nI place myself in the position of a sick dog awaiting its fate - hoping for signs of recovery but inevitably slipping back into sickness repeatedly until reaching a point where there seems no alternative but to metaphorically \"put it down.\" The thought weighs heavily on me - why does contemplating ending an animal's suffering feel so much more poignant than considering similar actions towards fellow humans?

{"prompt":"I have been feeling completely devoid of energy lately. I feel like there is no life left in me; I'm just an empty shell, and nothing seems to make a difference. It's exhausting to hear people advocating for professional help as if it's a magical solution for everyone because, in my case, it hasn't been. Sometimes, being a virgin adds an extra layer of despair that makes me wish I didn't exist. It's truly disheartening. It's hard to admit these feelings here because I often receive cliché advice that doesn't resonate with me at all.\n\nThe reason I struggle with being a virgin and feeling like a loner is deeply intertwined with my severe chronic depression, which suffocates my true self (it runs in the family – not because of my virginity). This condition drains all vitality from me, making me appear dull and uninteresting. Despite well-meaning suggestions like \"work on your personality\" or \"put yourself out there more,\" the reality is that depression manifests as an overwhelming sense of undesirability that no amount of effort or external changes can remedy. There are moments when the pain becomes unbearable, and all I can think about is ending it all. \n\nMy disdain for life intensifies as I drag myself through monotonous days at a job I despise only to return home consumed by depression. Even maintaining good physical shape fails to lift my spirits – confidence evaporates in the face of such deep-seated despair. Life feels like an inescapable sentence, and I dread receiving well-meaning but ultimately ineffective advice from others who cannot comprehend the depth of my struggles.\n\nThe weight of depression renders life a relentless struggle. Despite attempts to engage in different activities or improve myself, every endeavor seems futile and draining. Academic pursuits yield disappointing results despite relentless studying, physical training fails to yield significant gains compared to others, and attempts at social interaction fall flat due to an internal void that leaves me feeling soulless. Negative emotions overshadow any flickers of positivity, leaving me perpetually drained and disheartened.\n\nDepression exerts such profound control over every aspect of my existence that it renders life devoid of meaning or purpose. The only solace I find is fleeting enjoyment in video games, but even they lose their allure quickly. Suggestions to explore new interests only serve as a reminder that underlying depression taints every experience with its dark shadow.\n\nI find myself profoundly affected by the crippling nature of depression – its ability to strip away joy and render even the most mundane activities burdensome and joyless. The prospect of self-improvement or finding pleasure in simple pleasures feels unattainable within the confines imposed by this mental health condition.\n\nIt pains me how untouchably relentless depression can be – it saps any semblance of enjoyment from life itself. The rare moments when video games offer temporary respite quickly give way to a bleak emptiness where nothing seems worth anticipating anymore.

How can I even respond to that? It's like congrats on your luck while I struggle through each day in solitude, not speaking to anyone.

Mornings are especially tough, serving as a reminder of having to rise for college or school, which fills me with loathing.

Motivation eludes me entirely: after writing two stories, I hit a creative block and can't go on. Consistent reading is a challenge too; I pick it up for a month only to abandon it for three months later on.\n\nHow can landing a job be within reach when even activities I enjoy are hard to commit to?

It feels like I'm stuck in immaturity, and these feelings persist. My struggles with fatigue and dry eyes are coupled with tearful nights spent wrestling with emotional turmoil.\n\nI find it hard to pinpoint exactly what's wrong; being severely depressed and introverted contributes to feeling like the archetypal 'quiet one'.

It's as if life itself is a surreal dream we cling onto desperately. But in those moments of considering suicide, there is a stark sense of reality that floods in. The guilt towards my family, the raw pain of attempting to extinguish my own existence, the frustration of grappling with innate survival instincts, and the shame of falling short weigh heavy on me. I am contemplating another attempt, this time with a method that seems more definitive and harder to reverse unless medical intervention or an unforeseen miscalculation intervenes. The timing is uncertain, perhaps tomorrow or maybe in the coming days or months – it's all hazy. Plenty of opportunities lie ahead to make that choice again. It feels like no one really cares enough to notice or acknowledge these thoughts. Understandably so; I feel like a failure, abandoned and deceived repeatedly by those who once mattered. It drains me just thinking about engaging with anyone – replying to messages, initiating conversations – because deep down, I believe their interest is superficial at best and fleeting at worst. The cycle continues, reinforcing this belief that I am unworthy of love or support.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}

Despite reaching out here since June, I have faced nothing but failure. Every aspect of my existence seems to be tainted by inadequacy - a fact that has driven my family away, leaving me devoid of friends or any semblance of happiness. I harbored dreams of a life I could never attain, reserved only for the fortunate few, making suicide seem like the only viable option in my essentially purposeless and afflicted state. By tomorrow, as someone celebrates a joyous occasion surrounded by loved ones and abundance, I will be alone in my room with grim finality awaiting me. My possessions, aspirations, and even life itself are on the verge of disappearance. It may sound morbid, but I hope to remain undiscovered in my room as time takes its toll.\"\n\n\"I lament the unexpected complexities involved in preparing for one's own demise. While mentally ready to embrace death, the logistical aspects such as sorting out belongings and financial matters have proven daunting. Despite crafting numerous farewell notes that may go unread, tying up loose ends like closing accounts and organizing personal information has been a somber task. The absence of family to inherit anything doesn't trouble me; instead, I aspire for my modest assets to benefit charitable causes. This readiness to depart contrasts sharply with the societal pressure that prevents others from choosing their own fate due to familial ties or social expectations.\"\n\n\"In an ironic turn of events, tomorrow might see me expelled from school!

Maybe my therapist was mistaken.' Previously, I had always harbored the belief that others would be better off without me, convinced that my presence only brought burden to those around me.

The very prospect of improvement terrifies me because it always materializes. These periods of deep despair are fleeting.

My family recently had a major argument about all our issues and it has really taken a toll on me. I have been battling suicidal thoughts for about six years, and at 14, I made an attempt that I barely survived. There have been a few other close calls since then, but nothing fatal. Upon returning to my home country, I find myself stuck in the same difficult situation. My girlfriend has been my main source of support through all the pain, but my family does not approve of her. They used to run a program helping people who couldn't afford their visas, which my girlfriend benefitted from as well. However, when they found out about our relationship, they shut down the program and she had to leave. We talk about wanting to be together all the time, but circumstances make it nearly impossible. I am unable to save up enough money to visit her in Australia because of my current situation here. I haven't divulged to my family that we still communicate. It's disheartening; it feels like there is no purpose left for me as I strive for happiness but end up feeling like a lonely teenager trapped in a dark room, waiting for a stroke of luck. Watching everyone else progress with their lives, accompanied by their partners whom they dearly miss when apart, only adds to my sense of isolation after dropping out of school. Despite everything, I cling to the hope that one day we will overcome these obstacles and truly be together again. We have been in a long-distance relationship for a year now with just three months spent physically together before she had to leave.\n\nDealing with a Christian family who believe that being with her goes against God's will further complicates matters for me personally; however, in my heart, I believe that God - the author of love - would endorse our relationship if given the chance. Yet, that decision is beyond me.\n\nI am reaching a point where continuing seems futile; though I wish otherwise, it appears that this world may not be meant for someone like me at times when thoughts of her bring intense emotional pain.\n\nFeeling trapped and alone is becoming too much for me to bear right now.\n\nMy message is simple: Cherish those you hold dear - your partner whom you would go to great lengths for - because life is fleeting and not everyone gets their fairytale ending in reality\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}

The longing for something more has never resonated with me; there is simply no room for me within these norms. It's as if I suffer from an incurable condition or some deep-seated issue in my mind that sets me apart from those who share similar struggles. The emptiness within me has been growing for what feels like an eternity, yet not a single tear has been shed.

The realization of my worthlessness and profound loneliness haunts me every day, a loneliness born not just from my actions but also from a deeper place within. My drug-induced dreams present a more vibrant existence than reality ever could, emphasizing my desire for release from this existence where every flaw and inadequacy is magnified.

To provide some background, I am inherently compassionate and have dedicated my professional life to aiding others. Unfortunately, my past is marred by incidents of childhood trauma, adult experiences of sexual assault and domestic violence. Multiple diagnoses of CPTSD, depression, and anxiety have been attributed to me. Despite my efforts to seek assistance and follow recommended paths towards recovery, another layer of complexity arises from being an immigrant facing an unsafe environment in my home country. The uncertainty of my residency status weighs heavily on me as I await a decision next month.\n\nMy daily existence is plagued by relentless flashbacks, hours-long panic attacks, night terrors, and considerable challenges in maintaining regular eating and sleeping patterns.

Since leaving an abusive relationship, I find myself compulsively monitoring my ex's activities. Rationalizing this behavior as harassment troubles me deeply as it mirrors the kind of mistreatment inflicted upon me by past abusers. Despite earnest attempts to redirect my focus each day through engaging activities, I continuously fall short in ceasing this detrimental behavior. My persistent fixation on this individual has undoubtedly caused them significant distress.\n\nLooking ahead, should circumstances not favor my residing in a secure environment or witnessing substantial progress in my mental well-being by the end of February, I have made the somber decision to end my life. The idea of persisting in an unsafe environment is untenable for me; deprived of access to necessary treatments exacerbates this grim outlook. Regrettably, I acknowledge that the damage within me may render it impossible for me to be a safe presence for those around me; feeling profoundly unsettled within my own skin due to unresolved inner turmoil.\n\nReflecting on missed opportunities only adds additional sorrow to my plight – particularly regarding research projects that carry the potential for significant positive societal impacts.

Since then, there have been a few moments where I came close but didn't follow through. Returning to my home country only plunged me back into the same struggles.

Building trust feels pointless because history has shown that everyone eventually leaves. Despite the promises made - like the one my ex made about weathering storms together - they end up walking away when things get tough. It's a painful cycle that leaves me feeling foolish and betrayed every time. Cynicism towards humanity has taken root within me.

I feel absolutely fantastic. Screw this. Do you all want me to end my life? I'm exhausted. I'm consumed by a sense of being hopeless. Medication isn't effective. Therapy didn't make a difference. I see myself as a failure as a human being. I wish everyone would stop having faith in me because I doubt they will ever be satisfied. All I am is a lazy individual with numerous mental health issues. If only I could disappear so that everyone could move forward and forget about me. The idea of ending my own life is causing inner turmoil within me.\n\nMy upbringing was terrible. Abuse was a constant in my life since as far back as I can recall from the age of 3, and suicidal thoughts have plagued me since around the age of 10. Numerous visits to the mental institution, struggling to graduate due to poor attendance and lack of motivation, not pursuing higher education, working while enduring an abusive parent at home until eventually moving in with my significant other - one would think things should be better now but they're not. The chaos in my mind persists along with a variety of debilitating mental health issues, all while fearing that it's taking a toll on my partner even though she assures me she comprehends and supports me fully.\n\nShe urges me not to be so hard on myself over my imperfections, but deep down, I can't shake off the feeling that perhaps she's simply trying to convince herself and me for the sake of making things seem brighter. Despite loving her immensely, I dread pulling her down with me; she has immense potential for greatness whereas here I am nearly daily in tears with barely any strength to face the day.\n\nThe thought of suicide lingers constantly but the fear of causing pain to her holds me back. The emotional attachments keeping me tethered to this world are overwhelming; however, her presence in my life is just about sustaining me through this mental conflict that is slowly tearing away at my being.\n\nAt times, the desire to put an end to it all is overpowering - whereupon envisioning an end to my sorrowful narrative brings some semblance of peace by erasing consciousness, thoughts, and any traces of caring in an instant - though beneath it all lies the understanding that it doesn't truly end for others.\n\nI paint wild scenarios in my mind - hearing the screams from loved ones upon discovery, contemplating the psychological scars left behind, imagining lives altered irreversibly - all these possibilities brought forth by unbearable suicidal ideations that only serve as frightful measures to calm these turbulent emotions stirring within.\n\nAs much as loathing consumes both myself and this world, there exists an overwhelming fear of inflicting greater pain onto others than what already burdens me relentlessly - leaving me trapped in a conflicted state surrounding thoughts of self-harm along with the haunting consequences they bear.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

Despite recognizing some positive aspects like talents and qualities within myself, the predominant belief is that I am undeserving of life and harbor deep disgust for my very being.

I find solace in the idea of individuals who are willing participants in their own demise rather than innocent victims falling prey to senseless violence. I view myself as a hopeless case, devoid of any value or purpose among the vast population on this planet. The desire to escape this torment is so profound that I contemplate drastic actions to obliterate my existence entirely, seeking a way to vanish without a trace. The shame associated with expressing these thoughts is paralyzing, heightening feelings of inadequacy and revulsion towards myself. The idea of people delving into my life post-mortem in search of explanations for my choices amplifies my anguish, as I anticipate being reduced to a mere topic for brief discussion before fading into oblivion.

The weight of untreated health anxiety is crushing me. Even a minor incident, like receiving an electric shock while cleaning a light switch, sends me spiraling into panic, convinced that I have caused irreparable damage to my internal organs or heart. Despite medical tests showing normal results like a clear EKG and stable heart rate, the anxiety lingers, making me feel trapped in a relentless cycle of fear.

It seems like misfortune follows me at every turn; from being diagnosed with COVID-19 to landing in the emergency room after an accidental shock while cleaning – each event further pushing me towards thoughts of suicide.\n\nIn moments of despair, suicide seems like the only way out. My struggles with health issues such as a suspected liver parasite infection only add to my desperation for relief. The lack of validation from doctors intensifies these emotions, leaving me feeling hopeless despite knowing that a single pill could potentially cure me.\n\nDespite these challenges, my love for my girlfriend fuels a glimmer of hope within me - a desire to regain my health not just for myself but for our shared future together.

Our friendship faded because of my involvement in the furry community, and I haven't been able to find solace ever since. The longing for him and the emptiness I feel are unbearable, tempting me to put an end to everything, even though I dread causing pain to those around me. When I attempted to confide in my friends, their reactions ranged from discouraging to dismissive, with comments like: \"Let's avoid talking about him—it triggers my anxiety,\" or \"Just move on and stop fixating on him!\" They even went as far as calling suicide selfish or labeling him negatively. These responses have made me reluctant to seek help anymore. It seems like my world is crumbling and all I wish for is to undo the past where none of this turmoil existed, especially if it means keeping my furry identity hidden from him. Self-loathing consumes me entirely. My ultimate desire is that by departing from this life, I could transcend to a realm where none of these distressing events unfolded and be granted a fresh start. Ironically, it baffles me when friends later wonder how they could have supported me better, completely oblivious that my struggles were apparent all along, waiting for someone to acknowledge them; each time they failed at seizing those opportunities.

Despite putting in immense effort in recent weeks to simply keep my head above water, it seems as though my endeavors have amounted to nothing. These past weeks have pushed me to my limits, and each time I push back, the repercussions hit even harder. The cycle of trying only to be met with worsening circumstances is exhausting and disheartening. Why persevere when every attempt seems to backfire, further draining your resolve?

The ease with which he effortlessly connects with others while I battle solitude is disheartening. My academic pursuits seem doomed as I repeat past mistakes.

The sheer frustration of navigating through life is compounded by my heightened sensitivity and strained relationship with my mother. Adding to the weight of it all, the past year has been marked by aimlessness following my decision to drop out of college due to burnout and resign from my part-time job. If ending my own life wasn't such a daunting task, I would have bid farewell to this world back when I was just 15 years old.

He was so near that his private area was brushing against my back. Despite my attempts to move away, he persisted in touching me. Due to being reserved and socially anxious, I didn't confront him. Eventually, a store employee had to intervene and ask him to give some space, but he still didn't comply even though there was enough room.

{"prompt":"I feel like things are never going to improve, and I'm not sure how much longer I can hold on. It's hard to see a way out of this darkness. There's a weight on me, a burden that's been there since childhood when I was constantly targeted by bullies and even some teachers turned a blind eye to the abuse. My relationship with my mom is strained – she often shows more affection towards her boyfriend and threatens to kick me out whenever we have an argument. The few loved ones who stood by me are no longer here – friends have drifted away, family members have passed on, and supportive teachers are a thing of the past. The rest of my relatives seem to have forgotten about me completely. It feels like the people around me wish I wasn't here. Despite all this, I am grateful for the two friends who still care about me, though one of them is facing health issues and the other is always preoccupied with online school. It's tough feeling so isolated during the week when they're not around. Solitude can be comforting at times, but being alone in a crowd only seems to attract negativity and dark thoughts that weigh heavily on my mind. It's challenging being in high school dealing with all these emotions without much support from those around me. I've tried reaching out for help at school, but it only made things worse. My mom isn't interested in getting me therapy because she can't control what I share with a therapist, which goes against her wishes. Financial constraints also prevent me from seeking therapy independently as I don't have a job or money of my own. The constant ridicule from my mom and her boyfriend over my interests and choices makes everything even more unbearable; if they knew about my two friends, they'd likely find a way to sabotage those relationships too. While I acknowledge my imperfections and mistakes, it feels unfair that I'm always pushed to distance myself from those who care about me. It's hard to find reasons to keep going when everything feels so bleak except for the love I have for my two faithful friends – the thought of causing them pain weighs heavily on me too but sometimes it all feels overwhelming beyond comprehension.

At 16, enduring bullying since the age of five with no friends whatsoever, my parents only seem concerned about my academic performance which is currently poor. The fear of failing school looms over me; I anticipate severe consequences from my parents if I do fail. My isolation at school is overwhelming – mocked by everyone and finding solace only in the restroom. Socializing petrifies me; mistrust towards others immobilizes me entirely. Seeking help seems futile as confiding in the school counselor would result in parental disclosure; meanwhile, contemplating suicide fills me with dread of potential brain damage. Loneliness has always been my constant companion due to relentless bullying; the thought of ending it all this year crosses my mind daily.\n\nI am trapped within this cycle where seeking help feels impossible. My family reacts with anger and blame whenever I attempt to reach out; devoid of friends or past connections due to long-standing bullying experiences making any outreach seem futile.

Accessing supportive resources like suicide hotlines is hindered by their continual unavailability – a culmination that hints at ending my life successfully within this year.\n\nThe sentiment of never having had a friend remains painfully true throughout my life's journey breathes new hollowness into each passing day.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

Right now, all I long for is to connect with a community where discussions about suicide are genuine and raw.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" in"}
{"prompt":"They have shattered the little stability I had left. Just a few days ago, I was let go from my stable, well-paying job that allowed me to work from home with low stress and at my own pace. This job was a crucial anchor in my life, especially because I live alone after leaving my abusive ex-partner. With no one to rely on as my mother recently lost her job too, and feeling too proud to admit to my dad that I'm now jobless. The thought of possibly having to drop out of school only adds to the weight on my shoulders. Losing everything that provided comfort in a short Zoom call was a devastating blow. The specialized nature of my role means finding a similar paying job is unlikely, as it wasn't something easily transferable. Being able to support myself was the one thing that made me feel somewhat content with who I am, but now even that has been cruelly snatched away. It seems like my ex's hurtful words about me being worthless may be proving true after all.\n\nI'm exhausted from constantly having what little good there is in my life stripped away from me. It feels like an endless cycle of struggle and disappointment - just when something positive comes along, it disappears. At 27 years old, without a degree, partner, or employment prospects, it's hard to find a reason to keep fighting. The bleak realization that life has always been deceitful hits deep; even as a child, I sensed this but lacked the courage to act upon it due to external pressures and fears.\n\nNow the indifference towards continuing this charade grows stronger within me. Why should I continue bearing the burden inflicted on me by my parents? If they had truly cared about ensuring a brighter future for me when they were capable of doing so, perhaps things would have been different.\n\nThe contemplation of embarking on an isolated journey into the mountains lingers in my thoughts - wandering off the beaten tracks until finding a tranquil spot for solitude seems like a fitting end where peace can finally be found.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

Being so raw and vulnerable in such a dark moment was truly draining, and now that it's lost, I feel lost too. I just wanted someone to confide in about my overwhelming sense of hopelessness and the impossibility of finding solace when you're at your lowest. The urge to give up is strong; when I penned that post, death felt like the only answer, yet I simply yearned to articulate my emotions. It all seems like a meaningless form of torment right now. I dread being mocked for this; all I desire is not to perish, but even amidst and post that incident, hope eludes me.

{"prompt":"I find myself wishing for an end to all this and harboring resentment towards my parents. It's puzzling to me why these emotions persist when objectively, my life seems to be in order. I reside with my parents who are financially capable of providing for me, we live comfortably in a good home, and I have the luxury of acquiring things I desire. Additionally, I share a deep affection for my two adorable dogs, making it difficult to fathom leaving them behind. Currently enrolled in college (albeit struggling), I am on track to complete my studies in two years which would then pave the way for me to secure a job and venture out on my own. It's a contradictory feeling towards my parents - I care for them deeply, willing to make sacrifices for their well-being and missing them already at the mere thought of separation. However, there are moments when their reprimands drive me into a dark place where ceasing to exist feels like the preferable option. Their outbursts appear arbitrary and erratic; while academic performance doesn't typically trigger their anger, trivial matters such as finding stray hairs on the floor seemingly do. I suspect my mother grapples with OCD tendencies which might contribute to the situation. Despite being aware of their love for me, the incessant yelling persists unabated. The notion that perhaps achieving perfection in academics and household chores could mitigate their outbursts lingers as a distant hope. Yet, summoning the motivation to meet these expectations is an arduous task; sometimes just getting out of bed in the morning feels like an insurmountable challenge. The cascading sense of failure weighs heavily on me; recognizing areas where better self-discipline is needed becomes apparent against the backdrop of underlying anxiety and depression that haunt me daily. Managing these conditions via medication like Adderall and Paxil has certainly been beneficial as it eases social interactions and aids in academic pursuits. However, just when stability seems within reach, another wave of despair crashes over me – at times feeling abandoned even by my faith in God which usually provides solace.

The idea of someone glimpsing into my reality fills me with an intense desire to end it all. A part of me longs for the release of death so intensely that I wish a more fitting end awaited me, perhaps at the hands of a serial killer targeting those who crave an escape. I've convinced myself that my life holds no value amidst 7 billion others on this planet. The notion of obliterating myself in such a brutal manner as to erase any trace of existence is strangely comforting. The depth of my self-loathing is paralyzing, making the thought of anyone discovering these feelings utterly humiliating. My mind is consumed by a desire to shed my skin, to escape this unbearable reality. What gnaws at me even more is the certainty that if I were to act on these impulses, those around me would dissect my life searching for reasons, finding them not too far beneath the surface. The initial shock would fade into somber musings about how tragic it all was when speaking about me.\n\nWhile there might not be many deeply invested in my well-being, only scratching the surface of our connections, garnering fleeting concern before moving on with their lives, these thoughts weigh heavily on me.

The harsh reality is that the source of my suffering lies within – through self-inflicted psychological torment and the lingering effects of past traumas.

I perceive myself as insignificant to everyone, lacking value in terms of time and effort from others. Therefore, I shall remain here silently until I summon the strength and inspiration to act. Everything was going smoothly until I ruined it. The common advice is not to hinge your life and well-being on others, yet that's precisely what I have done.\n\nPreviously, my future seemed bright and full of promise due to my significant other; however, I've squandered the opportunities that lay ahead.

While residing with my parents is far from ideal for me, it seemed like the only option aside from contemplating suicide. The thought of what they now know makes me feel physically ill.

That's all I long for at this moment. The idea of ending my life before reaching 22 years of age crosses my mind.

In just a five-minute Zoom call, everything that provided comfort and routine in my life was mercilessly stripped away. The unique role I held within the company provided a substantial income but unfortunately does not translate into easily transferable skills for other job opportunities.

When a friend is in distress and contemplating suicide, many people's initial reflex is to try and solve the problem. Suggesting that a friend seeks professional help like seeing a psychiatrist can undeniably be beneficial.

Yes, hugs can be remarkably powerful. Think about the last time a male friend was hugged—it's often hard for them to recall. And for female friends, who would turn down a hug? Support is similarly crucial—an offering of support devoid of questions or advice can be more comforting than attempting to provide immediate solutions.

Dealing with a unique visual impairment that eludes my family's comprehension and renders me unable to drive. The likelihood of having had ADHD since childhood is quite high based on numerous telltale signs then and now. However, my family staunchly opposes the notion of mental health issues, dismissing depression and related conditions as mere excuses for laziness and immaturity. My brother asserts that I exhibit no sense of remorse or humiliation for my perceived slothfulness—a misguided assumption as self-condemnation festers within me incessantly as a form of internal punishment. Self-loathing pervades my being for past actions, current state, and anticipated future failures; I feel utterly inadequate, destined to repel any semblance of affection from others. Even my supposed \"best friend\" distanced herself due to my depression-induced melancholy that doesn't sit well with her. The temptation to end it all has visited me in various forms – drowning attempts, hanging endeavors, even contemplating leaping from the fourth floor of my residential complex – yet each time fear overwhelms resolve, branding me a coward who can't even follow through on his darkest impulses.

{"prompt":"Why am I burdened with such a wretched existence while those around me seem to have it so much easier? It feels futile to seek solace or understanding because I anticipate being met with the discouraging rhetoric of those who believe in victim-blaming like some followers of Peterson. They would likely advise me to exert even more effort, despite my current endeavors aligning with all that is deemed right. My misery stems predominantly from circumstances beyond my influence. Life appears as a relentless curse for many, contrasting starkly with the perceived paradise that some revel in. The prevailing trend seems to be a scenario where individuals toil longer and harder, only to receive diminishing returns, all in service of insatiable billionaire avarice. Remarkably, a blue-collar worker during the mid-20th century enjoyed a more comfortable standard of living than the present-day young professional does. As a male, traversing the landscape of love proves arduous; I face scrutiny when I seek equitable relationships (my desires are not rooted in superficial standards like physical appearance but rather fairness). The disparity is evident as women receive evaluations and offers, while men are expected to shoulder the entirety of relationship-building efforts - quite the parody of equality, isn't it? Time and again, I have endured bullying, harassment, and mistreatment throughout my life's journey. My parents refuse acceptance of my true self due to my differing beliefs from the strict religious upbringing imposed upon me; unfortunately, I lack a supportive partner to lean on for solace or refuge from this familial isolation. Moreover, grappling with the complexities derived from South Asian Muslim cultural norms remains an ongoing challenge even within Western society. My grievances seem futile as any attempt at voicing them is met with attacks, blame-shifting tactics, and callous indifference from unsympathetic individuals eager to compound my distress when I'm already at my lowest ebb. It's become apparent to me that approximately 99% of one's life trajectory hinges on luck - a supposition I hold firmly despite acknowledging that diligence and other contributing factors may yield marginal improvements.

{"prompt":"I'm overwhelmed and on the verge of breaking down. The weight of everything I'm holding inside is becoming unbearable. If I continue keeping it all to myself, I fear that I may resort to ending my life. Opening up seems impossible as every attempt to confide in someone ends in me either sharing just a fraction of what's going on or pretending that I've miraculously healed. There's only one person I feel somewhat comfortable talking to, though I can't understand why it's so challenging for me to open up to anyone else, not even my own mother. This individual happens to be the mother of a popular girl and also a teacher, someone I've known for most of my life but with whom my interactions have been minimal. Although there are other long-time acquaintances who are teachers as well, I find myself unable to share my struggles with them or with any stranger; each time, I find myself insisting that everything is fine when it clearly isn't. There was an instance when I tried confiding in one teacher and we conversed for about four months before I felt so ashamed of burdening her with my problems repeatedly that I apologized and vowed never to trouble her again - a promise which led me to withdraw from seeking support altogether. Despite attempting to seek help from various individuals, the pattern remains the same: putting on a facade of being fine and then disconnecting from them. But the reality is, I am far from okay. Regrettably, I've come to terms with the notion that ending my life is inevitable in the near future. While the exact timing is uncertain, the persistent thoughts plague my mind. Self-harm has unfortunately become a coping mechanism for me and suicide seems like a looming option, albeit not immediately because of my love for my dog which prevents me from taking that step just yet. It's been a considerable amount of time since I last reached out to anyone, and everyone around me believes that all is well with me; however, deep down, it's anything but okay.

{"prompt":"1. I am completely drained, devoid of life and spirit. Nothing seems to alleviate this numbness inside me. It's exhausting to hear people preach about how professional help can fix everything – it doesn't. Sometimes the weight of being a virgin pushes me towards dark thoughts. I feel utterly pathetic at times, and it's disheartening to share my struggles here, only to receive cliched advice. My chronic depression stifles my personality and makes me feel like an undesirable nobody. Suggestions to \"improve your personality\" or \"put yourself out there more\" feel tone-deaf because my depression engulfs me, leaving me dull and unresponsive. Life seems like an endless cycle of misery – from the mundane job that drains me to coming home too desolate for anything else. Even physical fitness fails to lift this heavy cloud over me; confidence is a distant dream when depression looms so large. I despise this existence and dread the inevitable hollow guidance that might follow this confession.\n\n2. Life feels like a prison sentence with no reprieve in sight; every day is a battle against the desire to give up entirely. The routine of a thankless job numbs me further, devoid of any solace from a loving partner's embrace. My world largely consists of lackluster video games that fail to distract me from this internal torment; experimenting with new activities feels futile when the real struggle lies within. The mere thought of expending energy on anything drains me even more – my perceived shortcomings in intelligence add another layer of self-loathing as I navigate through this bleak existence, clinging onto whatever semblance of hope remains.\n\n3. The constant struggle with life leaves me feeling depleted and weary; every effort I make seems futile in the face of perpetual failure. Despite investing years into self-improvement at the gym, the results pale in comparison, leaving me questioning my worth and competence. Social interactions remain a source of distress as my inner emptiness stifles any genuine connection or joy I might seek from others. The fatigue that engulfs me paints a distorted picture for those around me – seen as lazy by my own family without understanding the battles waging within me, contemplating the void just beyond reach.\n\n4. It's astounding how consuming depression can be, rendering even basic tasks insurmountable challenges at times. There's a deep yearning for more openness about suicidal ideation without facing immediate intervention or empty platitudes urging one to reach out for help constantly – which often misses the mark entirely on understanding the depth of despair felt within. This profound sense of hopelessness weighs heavily on every facet of life; pleasure becomes an elusive concept as joy dissipates into nothingness under depression's relentless grip, leaving relationships strained and aspirations lost in its wake.\n\n5. Depression casts a heavy shadow over my life, draining meaning from even simple pleasures like playing video games which quickly lose their appeal under its influence.

{"prompt":"I lost my temper with my dog again. I'm filled with self-loathing. Our dog, who is 14 years old, tends to bark and growl at me whenever I pass by while someone else is eating. My family believes it stems from her perceiving me as 'weak' due to my initial fear of dogs when we first brought her home. This belief only adds to my guilt, haunting me each time such an incident occurs. Tonight, it happened twice. During the first instance, I yelled at her to be quiet, and in the second, out of frustration, I yelled threatening words and even threw a blanket at her. My mom witnessed this and expressed being frightened by my actions. The fear that I might harm someone dear to me one day looms heavily on my mind. This realization makes me wary of forming close connections (not that I see that happening), fearful of my potential for losing control as I did with our unsuspecting pet. It's devastating to become what I abhor – someone who resorts to anger and outbursts, even towards an innocent creature like our dog.

Being a 30-year-old single father to a soon-to-be 8-year-old son, I can manage to cover my bills (albeit barely) and provide food and shelter for us. However, the weight of depression has burdened me even before his birth. The suspicion of his mother betraying me and departing four years ago has only exacerbated matters. While not professionally diagnosed, I assume so due to my perpetual perception of the glass being perpetually half empty and lacking any desire to continue living. As I age, thoughts of departing from this world become increasingly appealing. Naturally, I will wait until he reaches adulthood, but I struggle immensely with getting my life on track. Any career aspiration I hold seems out of reach due to my varying experience in unrelated fields. Women seem uninterested in me due to my \"dad bod\". It feels like I am at a juncture where success eludes me entirely. The notion of being a disappointment overwhelms me. Yet, despite attempts, motivation escapes me; rather, I feel like an insignificant presence taking up space. Navigating this existence seems insurmountable. While reluctant to label myself as suicidal - lacking the courage to act upon such thoughts - the prospect becomes more conceivable in eleven years’ time. For now, my son deserves better than a father marred by failure – an idea that torments me constantly. How do I cope with life's relentless agony? My sense of failure towards my son, parents, and those around me looms large. In this desolate state, what purpose do I serve beyond enduring ceaseless suffering?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

{"prompt":"I recently had a concerning conversation with a friend that has left me feeling quite distressed and unsure of how to proceed. Several weeks ago, she expressed her belief that I am at risk of taking my own life, even going as far as to mention placing a bet on it if given the chance. I was taken aback by her words and struggled to formulate a suitable response at the time. I attempted to lighten the mood with humor before briefly mentioning my ongoing efforts to combat my mental health issues and swiftly changing the subject. However, her comments have continued to weigh heavily on my mind ever since, causing me significant discomfort. It appears that her lack of faith in me has deeply wounded me, leaving me questioning our friendship dynamics.\n\nI find it difficult to comprehend why she chose such harsh and insensitive language when expressing her concerns. Had my diagnosis been physical, like cancer, rather than Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD), would she have adopted a similar approach in predicting my demise? It seems unlikely. This disparity in treatment troubles me greatly as it underscores a level of thoughtlessness and cruelty in her words. Consequently, I now struggle to interact with her normally and am hesitant about spending time together, despite her presence within my COVID bubble.\n\nAs someone accustomed to prioritizing others' comfort over my own feelings, I am grappling with whether it is acceptable for me to feel so hurt and unsettled by this situation or if I am perhaps exaggerating its significance. Ultimately, I am at a loss as to how I should address this issue moving forward without risking potential conflict given the typical reactions of those in my social circle when confronted with my dissatisfaction. Any guidance or advice on how best to navigate this delicate matter would be greatly appreciated.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}
{"prompt":"I feel like there is no way out for me except through suicide. My pain runs deep, and I wish for the world to feel the same anguish that I do. Those of you reading this are just glimpsing the tip of my psychological iceberg – a place where hopelessness reigns supreme. In protest of the laws against suicide, I plan to slash tires every night as a symbolic act of defiance. Though assisted suicide might have been a more merciful path, tonight my anger will manifest in destructive ways before I ultimately end my life with the help of a taser loaned by a friend.\n\nThe intensity of my emotions is overwhelming; every fiber of my being is consumed with hatred towards everyone I have ever crossed paths with, even fueled by irrational triggers like Drake Bell. This world appears nothing but bleak and unbearable to me, where love is an incomprehensible concept that eludes my acceptance.\n\nDespite recently encountering what seemed like genuine friendship and love from someone special, I find myself unable to embrace it. The pain from past betrayals and neglect feels like an insurmountable barrier – pushing me toward thoughts of ending it all by throwing myself under a train, convinced that America offers no hope or future for someone like me.\n\nDreams of starting anew in a country like Japan flicker faintly within me but seem unattainable due to practical constraints. The current state of affairs in America serves as a constant reminder of everything that is wrong rather than what could be right in my life. The idea of debt doesn’t deter me if it means escaping to a place where values align more closely with mine and where I might find purpose and stability as a taxi driver.\n\nLiving nomadically in my bus, drifting from one empty parking lot to another, has only amplified my sense of isolation and despair.

Though there has been some improvement in rebuilding a connection with my sister, I still find myself in immense distress. It seems probable that the trauma of past abuse and ongoing anxiety have resulted in a form of PTSD, further exacerbated by health issues that my therapist links to anxiety. The overwhelming sense of isolation and neglect consumes me, leading me to doubt if I'll ever experience genuine love and acceptance, fearing that I'm merely a burden on this world. Tears flow as I type these words, yearning for companionship and the comfort of growing old surrounded by someone trustworthy, not necessarily in a romantic sense. It feels like everyone either abandons me upon glimpsing my vulnerabilities or chooses to exploit them, forcing me to sever ties with them. This perpetual sense of abandonment intensifies the pain I feel even amidst attempts to seek solace in faith. Even during moments of respite like playing a game or reading, my body remains tense with discomfort. Few are willing to lend an ear without expecting payment in return. While I am fortunate to have a compassionate therapist who listens without judgment, the underlying fear of being truly alone persists without the financial exchange for her services. She advises staying present, yet it often feels akin to being stuck at the bottom of a desolate pit when attempting mindfulness. The shadow of being an outcast since enduring my father's abuse looms large, leaving an ongoing dread of perpetual isolation. Craving love and affection from those who would offer warm embraces and affirmations of worthiness feels like an unattainable dream as I grasp onto slivers of hope amidst the relentless anguish that engulfs me. Desperately clinging onto fragments of joy from simpler times echoes my struggles as confronting personal demons only seems to escalate their power over me. The notion that my absence would bear no impact underscores the fading presence I hold in the memories of those around me; however, I strive to find fleeting worth amidst the ceaseless suffering that defines each moment.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" in"}

My friends are drifting away because of my depression. Despite my attempts to explain my feelings, they doubt me since they don't see any cuts on my arms, only scars on my knees. I'm slowly losing hope in everything. It's currently 3:07 am and the idea of ending my life is haunting me.\n\nI've come close to trying to end things twice in the past three weeks but stopped myself inexplicably. Initially, I thought about overdosing, but now I'm considering jumping off a nearby 200-foot bridge, just an hour's bike ride away. I can't help but feel like a burden dragging everyone down around me. I face regular bullying, primarily due to my ADHD and severe anxiety, which often leaves me unable to defend myself or speak up except with those few whom I trust.\n\nThe emotional turmoil within me has been brewing for four long years now. The pain has reached a level where ending everything seems like the only escape from this agony. My father, an abusive narcissist from whom I fled four years ago after enduring physical and mental abuse since I was eight, still lurks as a looming presence in my past.\n\nDespite being aware that at 15 years old, there might be a future ahead of me, I am unable to envision it either physically or mentally. Even though therapy has been part of my journey, reaching out for help doesn't seem plausible right now as suicidal thoughts consume me entirely.\n\nAll I want is for this suffering to end by taking my own life; that's the stark reality haunting me every day now. While my mother remains a beacon of love and hope in this darkness, most other relationships have become strained or distant over time, exacerbated by the isolation brought about by another lockdown in the UK.\n\nIn short: feelings of being a burden are amplified by bullying due to ADHD and anxiety alongside PTSD struggles; ridicule and taunts about suicide attempts only deepen the sense of unworthiness that plagues me every day.

{"prompt":"Why do I even exist? Throughout my entire existence, I've only succeeded in failing. I've disappointed as a son, a brother, a partner, a parent, an employee, a friend, a grandson, and a nephew. Lately, I've attempted to end it all twice in the past 4 days with no success. The mere thought of facing my girlfriend or reaching out for assistance fills me with dread. It just dawned on me that I haven't truly looked at myself in the mirror for years because the reflection staring back at me is unbearable. Sure, I've glanced at my clothes or admired my new haircut superficially, but peering beyond the surface is a daunting task. I've meticulously crafted this illusion of being strong and capable, refusing to acknowledge that person no longer exists. Consequently, I've isolated myself from others as much as I have from my own reality. It's been four days since I last showed up for work; bedridden and emotionally paralyzed. My girlfriend likely believes I resent her for my inability to articulate my desire to end it all. As for my son whom I lost custody of last year – he must be wondering why his father has become so distant; however, deep down, I doubt my ability to positively contribute to his upbringing. My colleagues probably speculate about my sudden disappearance without any explanation but by now they may have written me off just like how I gave up on myself long ago. In moments of desperation, I rely on alcohol, cigarettes, and pills to numb the pain momentarily because during those instances self-loathing subsides temporarily; yet when clarity strikes through the fog of intoxication, self-contempt intensifies. Yesterday's attempt involved swallowing two dozen muscle relaxers and four dozen painkillers, secretly hoping not to wake up today – alas here I am once more proving myself inadequate.

{"prompt":"All I yearn for is a sense of normalcy. Sometimes I wish I were born without the burden of ADHD. I've lived with this condition all my life, expecting it to fade at puberty as some suggested, but it hasn't - instead, it has intensified over the years. It has molded me into someone who seems endlessly distracted and detached, resembling the lazy and erratic characters often depicted on TV. Everything seems too bothersome unless it captivates my intense focus, making me recite Wikipedia entries verbatim. My ability to engage socially and function as a typical individual dissipated with time. The criticisms directed at me were painfully accurate; I did exhibit inappropriate behaviors like trying to peek up girls' skirts, influenced by my fixation on anime back then. Consequently, I feel like an erratic outsider, a social misfit replaying the same books obsessively like a person possessed. Unsurprisingly, this led to relentless bullying during middle school, compelling me to vocalize thoughts of wanting to end my life—an ideation that has lingered since then.\n\nI harbor deep-seated fear not of meeting people but of losing them due to my inherent off-putting traits. Even my closest friend admitted their struggle in tolerating me. My lack of social filter often results in unintentional offenses and alienation from others. A poignant memory haunts me when my mother once hinted that their divorce would somehow be pinned on me - and indeed it was blamed on me. Regrettably, despite being handed every privilege imaginable - being white, male, attending private schools with affluent parents who covered my college expenses completely - I squandered every opportunity that came my way. Despite acquiring two seemingly worthless degrees that offer minimal career prospects today, any semblance of stability toppled when I lost a job gifted to me at my mother's workplace due to concerns about my mental well-being.\n\nAmidst these trials, loneliness envelops me like a heavy cloak. Deep down, I recognize myself as an undeserving outcast yearning for connections beyond what seems attainable by virtue of my appearance and lacking social prowess. Women instill fear in me more than anything else because I'm acutely aware of how unattractive and lacking in prospects or charm I come across as; thus far, any romantic relationship floundered shortly after inception.\n\nThe pursuit of therapy proved futile while medication dulls any semblance of joy or comfort that remains attainable through simple pleasures—a reminder that happiness feels out of reach even through conventional means.\n\nWith unshakeable resolve, all-consuming thoughts revolve around escaping this burdened existence; ending it all feels like the only viable resolution where peace can be found without being a perpetual weight upon others' shoulders.\n\nThis desire for normalcy transcends everything else—guiding an urgent plea for relief which can only manifest through departing this world without leaving behind a physical shadow haunting loved ones left behind to grapple with tragedy.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

She simply packed her bags and declared her departure. The lack of closure and uncertainty surrounding the situation has been agonizing. Enduring both physical and emotional abuse from her, I never confided in anyone due to the sense of emasculation it brought. It is challenging to disclose that my female partner resorted to violence during our arguments at home. Despite her persistent pleas for me to attend therapy over the years, I finally began the process during the pandemic, dedicating myself to personal growth and mental well-being. Sadly, she despised the improved version of myself that emerged from this journey. Now in my thirties, feeling devoid of purpose or zest for life, she absconded with all our mutual friends, leaving me utterly isolated.\n\nIn an attempt to regain some semblance of stability, I embarked on a journey across the country to be with family. However, this reunion only exacerbated my mental anguish and loneliness, highlighting why I distanced myself from them previously. Oddly enough, solitude accompanied by my loyal dog in my car seemed to bring more peace than any other circumstance at present. The negligence of my medication regimen combined with increased alcohol consumption - a behavior I had successfully curbed for nearly a year - paints a troubling picture. Today marks the consumption of my last Ativan dose; it served as a safety net preventing me from spiraling into despair. Anticipating reluctance from my psychiatrist to refill this prescription amplifies feelings of hopelessness within me.\n\nContemplating morbid thoughts, I find solace in the notion that perhaps some individuals are destined for self-annihilation as their sole purpose in life; gradually accepting this as my reality. Regrettably, disclosing such dark thoughts openly with either my therapist or psychiatrist is out of question due to apprehensions about being involuntarily admitted into care facilities. Aware that I would resort to deceit if confined under such circumstances only fuels suicidal ideation further.\n\nStruggling to comprehend why individuals whom I held dear harbor intentions to inflict such profound hurt upon me intensifies feelings of unworthiness and self-blame – convincing myself that perhaps karma plays a cruel hand in orchestrating these trials leading me towards an inevitable end.

I've allowed myself ample time since I started sharing here back in June of this year, but unfortunately, success eluded me. Every aspect of life where one could fail, I have failed at. This is why my parents harbor animosity towards me, why my family has distanced themselves or passed away, and why I find myself devoid of friends. My aspirations were set on a dreamlike existence only a select few get to experience, fully aware that it was beyond my reach. Given my circumstances, was suicide the only plausible resolution? Absolutely. My very existence seems like an error; not meant to happen yet inexplicably here — plagued by numerous afflictions and condemned to a purposeless existence for far too long. Everything I once possessed - my material possessions, finances, aspirations - is now lost, with only my life remaining on the brink of departure. While others indulge in lavish celebrations surrounded by loved ones and gifts tomorrow, I shall lie lifeless in my room with a fatal gunshot wound. As someone else steps into the life I dreamed of living posthumously, I desire anonymity in death — wishing not to be found but left undiscovered in decay within the confines of my room. It's astonishing that I've come this far and even more so that I anticipate the finality of death with eagerness. Oh well.\"\n\n\"I wish preparing for death was simpler... it's proving to be an arduous task beyond what I could have imagined - not just emotionally but practically too; dealing with belongings, finances, emotions, and more. I've penned nearly twenty notes even though no one will likely ever read them. My room stands tidy now, unnecessary accounts closed down; passwords documented for the remaining ones with intentions to empty my savings tomorrow if possible.\nImagine having to undertake all this groundwork at 70 — another reason compelling me towards suicide... who would willingly endure such tribulations during their twilight years? The concern lingers about the fate of my possessions; envisioning charity benefits from my money and high-value items like electronics soothes me as passing them on doesn't weigh heavy on me; charity work had always been an unfulfilled aspiration of mine anyway . Mentally prepared for death entirely, yet there's a fragment of worry concerning what little finances I possess.\nEmpathy arises for those considering suicide but pulled back by familial or social guilt; privileged as it may seem in my case, taking my own life had always been part of the plan for me. It appears life molded itself progressively towards making suicide feasible — losing everything until concerns about family or friends ceased completely.\nPlanning the method to end my life wasn't as challenging since they are mere words; however executing these plans come Saturday when it happens will undoubtedly be different. The execution and preparations toward demise have been taxing yet mark the final obligation left for me here on Earth; hoping the act of dying is less burdensome than what has led up to it.\"\n\n\"A peculiar turn events – potentially facing expulsion from school come tomorrow! Today was essentially about sabotaging myself deliberately; opting out of state exams knowing tomorrow holds the end for me via suicide makes academic neglect inconsequential now. Recklessly neglecting assignments signaled impending consequences which now seem immaterial as expulsion looms ahead as fitting retribution Finally receiving what’s due feels somewhat reassuring - may these final days be laden with added torment and misery.\"\n\n\"Should I leave notes behind for specific individuals close to my heart? As Saturday marks when I'll end my own life and while anticipation grips me towards death,, pondering over loved ones being unaware weighs on me heavily..

There are moments I ponder about the solace in ignorance, where complete oblivion to the ways of the world brings contentment through simplicity. If I were doltish enough to comprehend nothing around me, could I find gratification in life's minutiae? Yet, yearning to embrace idiocy isn't on my agenda; after all, who truly aspires to be intellectually bereft?\n\nSimilarly ensnared in envy towards everyone else yet adverse to emulating anyone’s existence is another paradoxical facet of how I feel. It’s as though pain has become my essence, a part of me that strangely holds an allure not to be eradicated. Oddly, there lurks a desire for more suffering – a craving for torment amidst labels that brand me as a loser, an incel wallowing in failure and reproachful glances. Nightfall ushers in profound solitude where the feeling of being the sole survivor invokes fear within me – though paradoxically repelling any notion of seeking solace in another's company; mistrust and detestation reign supreme towards all beings without exception. Accepting fear seems imperative – an acknowledgment that every negative emotion should wash over me like shards of glass piercing through skin. Pain becomes almost euphoric; let it encompass every fiber of being.\n\n\"Now what?\" resonates with bitter resignation – hope was never part of my narrative anyway. While others basked under the warmth of support from kin or companions - be it familial ties or friendships forged along life’s journey – I treaded a solitary path then as now. Friendship never graced my shores; parental love felt like an elusive concept growing up had ostensibly introduced into other lives but mine remained untouched by such affections. Witnessing others revel in happiness only furthers corrodes whatever semblance of resolve exists within me. One gets to relish childhood once; yet mine seems like fleeting shadows never truly experienced or cherished fully by someone undeserving - possibly why emptiness engulfs every facet of existence thus far lived.\nThe journey through teen years mirrors an existence devoid of purpose reminiscent almost as though birth occurred just yesterday - ignorant and fumbling through life without direction or skillset worthy enough for recognition profound those around while marking a failing grade upon selfhood etched with critiques more vitriolic than constructive feedback.\n\nEngulfed by struggles with poor dietary choices morphing into addiction serves as interlude steering clear from substances alcohol or nicotine deeming them detrimental only to adopt junk food as companions robbing incessantly off any resolve initially harbored against substance abuse prevalent within society today under guise 'socially accepted'. The facade crumbles under the crushing weight bearing down relentlessly upon shoulders.\nCascade self-hatred echoes its refrain incessantly across four walls stifling any glimpse hope yearned devoured

It seems to me that I'm nothing but a selfish, constantly complaining individual who lacks the drive or will to make any positive changes in my life. Instead of seeking improvement, all I seem capable of doing is generating frustration among those who may harbor any wish to see me progress because, truth be told, deep down, I have no desire for improvement nor do I believe that I am worthy of it. In my mind, the only fitting end for me would be a quick and definitive one — a bullet through my skull. My routine consists of only griping about my circumstances without ever taking real action to alter them. Despite vocalizing my feelings of loneliness, have I ever taken the step to connect with others? The answer is a resounding no. And even if by some miracle I did reach out, would it truly make any difference? Again, the answer most likely would be in the negative. My days are consumed by sorrow, lethargy, and an endless cycle of self-absorption with my own issues which have undoubtedly burdened those around me for far too long. In all honesty, what I truly yearn for is someone to metaphorically crush me like the insignificant being that I perceive myself to be.

Working 8 hours on the weekends leaves me wanting to take a nap afterwards – isn't that normal? However, my family seems to think otherwise; today, they have labeled me as utterly useless. My academic performance has declined, provoking their anger and branding me a failure and a letdown. Despite my attempts to explain my emotions, including feelings of cowardice and contemplation of drastic measures, they show no concern. Their focus remains solely on my grades and household chores. Labeled as lazy and ineffective, with plummeting grades spelling doom for my college prospects, I feel burdened by overwhelming expectations.

I'm currently back in therapy, so there's hope that things might improve for me. I do struggle with strong bipolar inclinations, which sometimes resemble traits of my abusive uncle, although I have no intention of causing physical harm and am wary of my capacity for manipulation. Despite the ongoing feelings of loneliness, confusion about my future, I have been relatively better lately compared to my past experiences. I am gradually embracing my true self, regardless of whether or not I like what I discover about myself. To anyone out there feeling helpless, remember there is always room for growth even in the darkest moments. Hitting rock bottom can be a transformative experience; it was during the depths of severe depression and bipolar episodes coupled with nearly two years of intense struggles that I hit mine.

Despite reaching out to the authorities in the past regarding the abuse, I was met with disbelief as I lacked tangible evidence to support my claims. The authorities dismissed me, insinuating that I was simply being rebellious and unappreciative towards my well-intentioned yet flawed parents.\n\nThrough bullying and emotional manipulation, my parents coerced me into retracting my allegations and convinced me that I was the one at fault, leading me to apologize to them through tears. The fear they instilled in me of potential harm or danger prevented me from taking any legal action against them. This coerced silence weighs heavily on me, and it feels like a suffocating burden.\n\nConfiding in this platform is currently my only outlet as seeking professional counseling is not an option at the moment. Furthermore, my parents are actively impeding any attempts I make to move out and gain independence. Despite the strong desire to seek a restraining order or establish no-contact boundaries with them, the absence of concrete evidence makes it nearly impossible.\n\nThe sense of helplessness and despair in this situation is overwhelming, and I struggle with self-loathing for allowing their manipulation tactics to prevail.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" in"}

I used to engage with another account but stopped because it doesn't feel helpful here. Is life even worth it if there's no joy in it? I've been feeling terrible for so long, and no amount of medication seems to make a difference. My future looks bleak, and self-loathing consumes me. Sometimes, I wish I didn't have people who care about me so that ending things would be easier. Can anyone relate to feeling like an utter failure and undeserving of life? Every day feels the same – monotonous and empty. This existence is unbearable; self-hatred clouds my thoughts constantly. The fear of pretending creeps in, but deep down, all I yearn for is an end to this suffering. My future holds no appeal; educational pursuits seem impossible, and my doctor suspects Asperger's may be at play. The losses and pain of 2020 have depleted me, leaving little reason to keep going. While young at 17, dismissing my struggles with \"you're too young\" only adds to the despair brewing within me about what lies ahead. The looming prospect of turning 18 soon triggers thoughts of ending it all come November – this cycle of non-functional depression is unbearable. In therapy when asked about my five-year plan, the bleak thought of hanging from the rafters is all that comes to mind. The broken heating system during freezing temperatures only further exacerbates my depression, self-loathing, and suicidal ideation.

Physically, a peculiar eye condition plagues me, an issue that my family struggles to comprehend. This impairment extends to my inability to drive, compounding feelings of inadequacy. Signs of ADHD have lingered since childhood, yet my family dismisses mental health struggles as mere laziness or immaturity. My brother's accusations of lacking guilt or shame for perceived laziness only add to the weight crushing down on me.

A minor marijuana charge has shattered my career aspirations, closing the doors to my dreams. The thought of ever having a meaningful relationship or starting a family seems unreachable. Coupled with what I perceive as low intelligence, it leaves me feeling like a dead end. While I have the means to sustain my existence, the desire to do so is absent. Happiness eludes me and the prospect of finding it appears bleak. Despite having loved ones around, it seems like they would manage fine without me; although it might be hard on my mother, she has other sons to live for. At just 18, everything already feels like a downward spiral, with shattered dreams and a soul crushed by despair. The will to live has been extinguished from within me; there seems to be no compelling reason to carry on except for the expectations of others, which feels somewhat selfish. Thoughts of death consume me daily as I ponder its inevitability and how I could minimize the impact on my family before taking that step towards suicide.

{"prompt":"What reason is there for me to hold onto hope anymore? It's abundantly clear from every experience I've had so far that my path to happiness was never meant to be. I'm learning the hard way not to allow myself to expect good things or feel enthusiasm about anything, as it always ends in disappointment. The harsh truth is that things never improve, and my dreams will forever remain out of reach – that much is certain. Spare me the empty reassurances about how everything will inevitably turn around. I've been grappling with this for a considerable amount of time now. People advise me to be patient and all that generic advice, but let's be honest, none of it cuts through the facade. The urge to end it all grows stronger within me each time I dare hope for something because the subsequent failure cuts even deeper each time. If only I could numb my emotions, maybe then I could find contentment in whatever little life offers me. My childhood was a nightmare – a period that likely shaped my current messed-up state. The torment from so-called friends and even my own parents has ingrained in me the belief that no one can be trusted, not even those closest to you, as they're quick to betray and inflict pain if you don't conform to their expectations. Sadly, I can't place trust in myself either; after all, I am the architect of my own downfall. Regrettably, I've also allowed myself to become a perpetrator of cruelty just to temporarily boost my own ego – mirroring the very behavior that repulses me in others. Maybe suffering is what I deserve after all; why then do only *my* \"friends\" get a free pass? Perhaps it's time they faced some consequences too for their actions... No woman has ever shown interest in me either, and yes, it stings that my worth seems reduced to something as shallow as sexual conquests. But for me, it's more than mere physical intimacy; connecting with someone on a deeper level isn't as simple or straightforward for me as it might be for others. The pressure and ridicule surrounding my virginity forced me into deception among my peers – highlighting the toxic nature of these relationships where pretense is essential for survival against ridicule and ostracization. Finding genuine affection from a woman now seems like an unattainable fantasy at this point; sometimes I wish I could just rid myself of these desires altogether by being asexual and avoiding this heartache entirely... Family holds no inherent value beyond mere biology – existing because two individuals decided to procreate doesn't automatically ensure proper nurturing or care; love often muddles with discipline until lines blur between punishment and affectionate guidance - like when my father thought using his belt on 8-year-old me for failing at shoelaces was well-intentioned discipline... Should gratitude then be expected? Should appreciation flow when faced with potential rejection from loved ones due solely on religious grounds? The notion of unconditional love quickly crumbles once you resist conformity – an ultimatum that demands submission above all else; yet submission feels akin to surrendering one's autonomy entirely... Friends masquerading as manipulative parasites foster dependency under the guise of companionship - where loniless becomes unbearable without them yet conforming demands sacrificing individuality against persistent taunting... What exactly am I supposed endure this clusterf*ck called life for anyway? Family – those who thrust existence upon me without adequate preparation or guidance? Friends - who subjected me to cruelty and now seek conformity with someone alien to who I truly am? Love - characterized by watching others find happiness while left uneasily watching from margins.copy What are\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

{"prompt":"Could anyone just show me some love? This year has utterly shattered me mentally. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep going. It all just seems like a painful journey leading to a place of purposelessness. My reliance on substances stems from a deep craving for love. Does anyone else relate to this feeling? Despite being married, I feel incredibly isolated in my own thoughts. I long for my spouse to reciprocate the care and concern I have for them. It felt like abandonment when they weren't there for me during my mental health struggles. Being with someone who didn't truly value them deeply affected me when I needed their support the most. The harm caused by this is beyond repair. I detest the normalization of polyamory and open relationships nowadays. Not only do I feel distanced from my friends, family, and everything else around me, but also from my partner who should be helping me navigate this pain and bringing comfort. After enduring Covid-19 and all the other chaos of this year, I am just done with life. Once I complete one final project, it will all be over for me. I am strangely eager to surrender to the void of death without feeling any guilt.

{"prompt":"I'm an 18-year-old guy and I'm struggling to find the right words to express how I feel. Over time, I've resorted to self-harm as a way to transform emotional pain into physical pain, resulting in a body now marked with scars from head to toe. Since the young age of 12, I've been grappling with a persistent feeling of numbness. Recently, due to psychological issues, I was discharged from the military and referred to a psychiatrist. The diagnosis made was sociopathy and self-harm. Lately, thoughts of suicide have been haunting me as life seems devoid of any happiness or love. My engagement last summer feels like an empty commitment fueled by habit and the care shown towards me rather than genuine emotion.\n\nUnexpectedly, I reconnected with a past love interest who has gone through profound changes, battling depression and enduring multiple instances of rape. As we started conversing again, for some inexplicable reason, I found myself drawn to her – perhaps because of our shared struggles or her damaged state mirroring mine. Our brief time together brought a rare moment of joy, breaking through my usual numbness. However, after parting ways the next day, I couldn't shake the thoughts of her from my mind.\n\nMy attempts to reach out were met with silence until I discovered she had tried to take her own life by cutting her wrists while intoxicated. She's now in a mental health facility with an uncertain release date. Despite this harsh reality, she agreed to give our relationship another chance but remains undecided about her future. We made a pact that if she decides on suicide, we would do it together – leaving me utterly lost.\n\nBefore meeting her again, death seemed like a welcome escape; however, now her absence would extinguish any dwindling desire for life within me.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

I'm exhausted by those who adamantly assume that my self-harm is either a cry for attention or merely an act. Having struggled with self-harm in the past, I've reached a point where it seems like nobody truly comprehends the pain I'm going through. A few months ago, consumed by numbness and emptiness, I seized the opportunity while my girlfriend was out for a walk to attempt to alleviate some of my anguish. Upon her return, she discovered my arm and understandably panicked. During a subsequent conversation with some friends in person, a few of them callously laughed and told my girlfriend, \"Why are you with someone craving attention? She leads a more privileged life than most – you should leave her for someone who isn't seeking attention through self-harm.\" Those hurtful remarks left me inconsolable for days, tearfully seeking solace in my girlfriend's embrace each night. When my girlfriend confided in a friend about our struggles, instead of offering support or empathy, he callously asserted, \"She's probably lying; she didn't actually cut herself – she's just pretending to be a cutter,\" and even went as far as encouraging my girlfriend to harm herself. Some days I question whether it's all even worth it anymore; there's even a disturbing account of someone dismissing my sexual orientation as genuine.

{"prompt":"I have been grappling with depression for an extended period, dating back to my early school years, and it has only worsened with time. At 19, my life has taken a turn for the worse. Losing both my parents - my mother four years ago and my father five years ago - has left a profound void. Although my mother subjected me to mental and physical abuse, I harbor no resentment towards her, understanding that her actions were influenced by her own mental health struggles. On the other hand, my father was absent from my life since I was around 11 or 12; he passed away in a car accident. Despite their separation, I deeply miss them both.\n\nMy initial suicide attempt involved using a phone charger when I couldn't find rope, driven by overwhelming hopelessness. After that incident, I made a half-hearted promise to enlist in the military and meet my end in combat. However, after moving in with my aunt and uncle, things began to change. It appeared that everything was looking up - I excelled in school, had supportive relationships around me, yet deep down, self-loathing persisted. While others saw me as resilient and supportive, I couldn't shake off the feeling of being undeserving as if I rode on their support and love to achieve anything. High school graduation and college acceptance felt like accomplishments handed to me rather than earned through effort.\n\nAs soon as college started, everything began to unravel rapidly. My academic performance plummeted, putting even my job at risk now. Despite multiple suicide attempts looming in the background, the thought of inflicting pain on my family always stayed my hand. Each day becomes more arduous than the last; recently getting arrested for possessing shrooms added another layer of complexity to an already strained situation.\n\nVenting about these emotions is not something I do; every time someone asks how I am feeling, I fabricate a response due to the mental exhaustion that comes with opening up about these struggles. The idea of death seems like the ultimate solution to end all familial troubles that seem to revolve around me as if I am the cause of all problems driving everyone away.\n\nMoving onto campus seemed like a relief for my aunt and uncle's family dynamics which seem to be improving without me around. Lately, contemplating ways to end things but make it appear accidental has occupied my thoughts, yet options beyond seeking help from hotlines elude me due to phone anxiety.\n\nSharing this online feels more comfortable than speaking with a stranger over the phone; hence this heartfelt venting session here means more than words can express.

It begins innocuously enough - witnessing someone being praised triggers a cascade of inadequacy within me, compelling me to believe that worthiness of love hinges on achieving similar accolades. Even minor triggers like observing a simple drawing can plunge me deeper into despondency.

My life feels overwhelmingly bleak due to circumstances beyond my control. It seems like life is just a series of misfortunes for many, while others experience nothing but bliss. The current reality of toiling longer and harder for dwindling rewards seems designed solely to feed the insatiable greed of billionaires. Back in the '50s-'70s, even a factory worker enjoyed a better quality of life than a young professional does now. As a man, it's proving incredibly challenging for me to find love, and when I strive to uphold certain standards in relationships (all I want is fairness, not some superficial ideal like a blonde-haired princess), I face criticism. While women receive attention and choices, men are left shouldering all the effort in dating dynamics (some equality we have, right?). Throughout my life, I've endured bullying, harassment, and consistent mistreatment. My parents are unable to accept me for who I am since I don't adhere to the rigid beliefs of our upbringing; however, without a supportive partner by my side, escaping this situation seems impossible. The challenges within South Asian Muslim culture remain profound even here in the Western world. Whenever I express my struggles or dissatisfaction with my circumstances, I'm met with attacks and victim-blaming; it's as though there's always someone eager to kick me when I'm already down. It feels like 99% of one's life is dictated by luck; of that much, I am certain.

On Monday, I tried to end my life, and since then, I've been grappling with physical pain, overwhelming depression, and a persistent desire to not exist. Surprisingly, the toughest challenge has been dealing with school. Despite my best attempts to cope after a failed suicide attempt, the pressure of school has been unbearable. The thought of having to immediately resume school after such traumatic experiences feels impossible. I've been putting in so much effort, only to still feel like a failure in the eyes of others.\n\nThe past few days have felt like an eternity with Friday being my only motivation. I've been looking forward to that day as a time when I can finally receive my birthday presents and engage in activities that bring me joy again. The isolation and punishment have made this period even more excruciating. It's disheartening when it seems like every effort I make goes unnoticed or unappreciated.\n\nThere are moments where the weight of it all feels unbearable. While I don't have immediate plans to harm myself right now, the desire for an escape from this agony remains strong. Each day feels like a relentless battle where any positive steps forward are quickly overshadowed by feelings of inadequacy and despair.\n\nI've reached a breaking point where everything feels utterly hopeless. Despite trying my hardest, it seems like nothing I do is ever enough or valued by those around me. This consistent invalidation has left me feeling empty and dejected.\n\nI find myself at a loss for what steps to take next as the sense of giving up grows stronger each day. Each passing day brings me closer to the hope of turning 18 when perhaps there will be an end to this endless struggle that feels insurmountable right now.\n\nIt's become increasingly clear that my presence only complicates things for everyone else. The overwhelming sense of guilt and self-blame weighs heavily on me, pushing me further towards thoughts of not wanting to exist anymore.

{"prompt":"Does anyone know of any online platforms where I can openly discuss my struggles? I feel like something is seriously wrong with me, and I fear that I may pose a danger to myself and others. Hello,\n\nI need to get something off my chest.\n\nBackground: I am incredibly compassionate and generous by nature. My entire professional life has been dedicated to assisting others. However, I have a history of trauma from my childhood, as well as experiencing sexual assault and domestic abuse as an adult. Various mental health professionals have diagnosed me with CPTSD, depression, and anxiety on multiple occasions. Despite my efforts to seek help, the road to recovery remains challenging. Additionally, as an immigrant, returning to my home country is not an option due to safety concerns. My application for staying in a secure environment is pending, with a decision expected next month. \n\nI struggle daily with relentless flashbacks, prolonged panic attacks, recurring nightmares, disordered eating habits, and insomnia that has persisted for an extended period. To put it into perspective, over the last six months, I have experienced barely four hours of respite during my waking moments consistently.\n\nI've come to the realization that I am a danger not only to myself but also to others due to deep-seated emotional damage. Since ending a toxic relationship with my abuser, I find myself obsessively checking up on them – a behavior that borders on harassment. This unhealthy fixation mirrors the patterns of behavior exhibited by those who have hurt me in the past. Despite my best efforts to distract myself and move on, I continuously fail in preventing contact with them. The distress this causes them weighs heavily on me as it perpetuates their suffering.\n\nMy current plan involves taking my life before February concludes if I am unable to secure residency in a safe environment and experience progress in managing my mental health issues. The looming threat of physical harm is intolerable for me once more, especially considering the lack of access to necessary treatment for addressing my underlying issues. It pains me deeply to acknowledge that I have become a source of harm both internally and externally. My inner turmoil has driven me towards this decision because regardless of my unceasing efforts at self-improvement, I cannot shake the feeling of being inherently unsafe within myself.\n\nWhile reflecting on regrets, it saddens me that unfinished research projects with the potential for significant positive impact may never see completion. Being cognizant of my intelligence and hard work ethic intensifies this sense of loss as these projects could have positively impacted numerous lives.\n\nI welcome any perspectives or advice at this point in time. There's no need to remind me of how broken and harmful I perceive myself - the pain is already all-consuming enough for me at present.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

Everybody eventually exits, particularly those who pledged their enduring presence. At times, I introspect and ponder if the fault lies with me. However, I gradually recognize that my subconscious anticipation of their departure inadvertently drives them away; it's more of a preemptive mindset of \"let's get this over with.\" As for those who hesitate to remain, I fail to provide ample reasons for them to linger. Consequently, it's no surprise if they choose to depart. If given the chance, I might even abandon myself; hence, I hold no resentment towards these individuals for opting to leave.

{"prompt":"My sense of stability has been completely shattered. I was let go from my job last Wednesday, which was a well-paying, low-stress, work-at-your-own-pace position that I could do from home. This job was the last source of stability in my life. I live alone because I fled from an abusive ex-partner, so I don't have anyone to lean on until I secure new employment. My mom is also facing unemployment, and I am too proud to admit to my dad that I have lost my job. Additionally, I am currently studying, but I may have to drop out of school. Losing all the comforts and securities in my life during a brief Zoom call has been devastating. The specialized nature of my role within the company makes it challenging to find a comparable job opportunity elsewhere. This unique skill set is not easily transferable or marketable in other fields. Achieving financial independence was a significant milestone for me amidst life's hardships, and now that has been abruptly taken away. It almost feels like my ex's hurtful words about me being unworthy and better off dead are coming true. The possibility of reclaiming that stable ground seems distant and uncertain, perhaps even out of reach for years to come – if ever.\n\nFeeling worn down by the continual loss of all that is good or decent in my life is draining. It seems like an endless cycle of struggle and effort only to have anything positive swiftly snatched away at any moment. At 27 years old, lacking a degree, partner, or job leaves me feeling unattractive and unintelligent with no clear purpose ahead. Since childhood, I've harbored a deep skepticism towards the idea of living being worthwhile – it always felt like a scam designed to deceive us into enduring unnecessary suffering.\n\nThe thought of vanishing into the mountains, wandering off-trail until finding a secluded spot to end everything crosses my mind frequently now – picturing a peaceful rest after so much chaos almost seems inviting as an end to this relentless struggle. All these years, concern for others' reactions and fear prevented me from taking such drastic steps – but now those inhibitions are fading away; why should their emotions matter when they did not invest in securing my future? The indifference shown towards shaping the path ahead makes me question why their emotional well-being should be more important than mine in this moment of profound despair.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

Perhaps hiring someone to pull the trigger is an option. The thought of my beloved pets starving if I were to end my life weighs heavy on me. I've cherished them since childhood; my dogs mean the world to me.\n\nMy parents' disdain for animals is evident as they barely cared for my pets during brief absences, providing only minimal food and water. I've always ensured their well-being before any trip, but the fear of leaving them in my parents' care persists. While I couldn't bear to see my pets suffer without me, I struggle to find a reason to keep existing myself.\n\nI recently made a reckless decision, stabbing myself with a knife. However, that's not the real issue at hand – currently contemplating an overdose with pills even though I know it's a painful way to go. The wound isn't severe, but it symbolizes my lack of belonging in this world after all that has transpired.\n\nThe desire for a dramatic end like dying in a car crash frequently occupies my thoughts. Whether driving into a tree or off a cliff, these fantasies fill my mind as I wish not to see another day. At times, the impulse to stab myself in the heart arises due to the immense hatred I harbor towards the world.\n\nAmidst deep suffering caused by others, violent thoughts occasionally surface of inflicting excruciating pain on those responsible. Despite such vengeful urges, humanity and conscience hold me back from acting on them.\n\nThree years ago today marked the setting of my self-imposed deadline - contemplating death through CO poisoning or car exhaust in an enclosed space for swift release from enduring decades of pain and torment. From enduring an abusive childhood and racial discrimination at school to battling mental illness and bullying - each joyful moment in life seems fleeting and snatched away abruptly.\n\nDespite enduring for so long under mounting burdens and challenges that seem insurmountable - facing possible expulsion from school due to a nonsensical situation became the breaking point today.

She constantly belittles her weight in various ways. Furthermore, she has fabricated manipulated images portraying fake interactions between my friend and herself, presumably to tarnish my friend's reputation. Despite my friend’s simple request to be left alone, this woman persists. It has been ongoing for five days now, during which time she has created a staggering 17 Instagram accounts solely for the purpose of tormenting her, in addition to using seven different phone numbers and two Facebook profiles.\n\nThe continuous harassment is taking a toll on my friend's mental well-being; she is chronically fatigued, neglecting self-care, and isolating herself.

Not long ago, overwhelmed by emptiness and numbness, I succumbed to the urge to harm myself while my girlfriend was out for a walk.

Despite my repeated attempts, I struggle with job interviews and feel trapped in a vicious cycle.

I am easily overwhelmed, find it challenging to advocate for myself in unfair situations where I am often mistreated.

Unfortunately, suicide feels like the only escape from this suffocating reality. This financial insecurity is currently my primary concern, amplifying my self-perception as lacking intelligence and struggling to secure references or be proactive due to poor memory. My lack of interest in any activities contributes to my overall sense of emptiness and feeling crushed by life's challenges. At 22 years old, I feel the increasing weight of responsibilities mounting on me with each passing day, leaving me deeply anxious about the future. Though thoughts of hanging have crossed my mind, I cannot bring myself to follow through with such drastic actions. Turning to online platforms like this one periodically to vent about my frustrations and disillusionment has become somewhat of a coping mechanism for me amidst feeling belittled by coworkers and lacking any meaningful connections or friendships. Despite not actively seeking companionship, deep down, I acknowledge that it affects me on some level as someone who struggles with social interactions due to feeling socially inept and overly sensitive.

My main motivation now is earning enough to cover my bills and perhaps see my friends occasionally. I used to have aspirations and ambitions, things I thought I would never lose sight of. But when I attempted to create some art recently, the result was so disappointing that it drained me completely. Crafting used to bring me joy; I relished in the act of trying new things and letting my creativity flow without concern for time being wasted. However, the overpowering influence of capitalism and the need for instant gratification have severely impacted my mental state. This wasn't how it was supposed to be for me, but here I am. Unsure of where my path leads or if there's a future worth pursuing. Everything feels uncertain and blurred now. I hold onto a glimmer of hope that this phase will pass soon, but then again, perhaps it won't - and that’s just part of life too. Is settling for a mundane existence working a corporate job that brings contentment acceptable?

{"prompt":"Someone on this platform came across my post and demanded $50, stating that I should donate to those less fortunate since I wouldn't be needing it. It's absolutely not helpful and only adds to my frustration. Is this community suggesting that I end my life? I am worn out, feeling like a lost cause. Medication has proven ineffective, and therapy hasn't made a difference. I see myself as a failure as a person. I wish everyone would stop having faith in me because it seems unlikely they will ever be content. All I view myself as is a lethargic mess with numerous mental health issues. It'd be easier if I could just disappear so everyone could move on and forget about me. My thoughts are conflicted about suicide.  \n\nMy upbringing was horrendous, enduring abuse from as far back as my memory serves at 3 years old, leading to ongoing suicidal thoughts since about age 10. Multiple stays in mental health facilities have been necessary, and barely completing high school due to inconsistent attendance and lack of motivation was a challenge. College wasn't an option; instead, I worked while residing with an abusive parent until eventually moving in with the person I love. One would think things should be better now, but they're not. The turmoil in my mind persists, compounded by a myriad of crippling mental conditions that weigh heavily on me. There's a fear that all this is affecting my partner despite her reassurances that she comprehends and supports me fully.\n\nAlthough she advises me not to dwell on my failures, I can't shake the feeling that she's merely trying to console both herself and me with false encouragement. My love for her is immense, yet I dread pulling her down with me. She holds great potential for a fulfilling life while here I am, crying nearly every day with barely enough strength to get out of bed in the morning.\n\nEnvisioning no future for myself even with years of therapy and prescribed medications leaves me feeling like an insignificant burden. At times, the idea crosses my mind to push people away by behaving unpleasantly so they wouldn't miss me if I were to end everything abruptly.\n\nThe internal battle rages on; although her presence keeps me barely hanging on, the mental turmoil threatens to consume both myself and my simplistic mind entirely. The temptation to end it all lingers because it promises an escape from my woeful narrative along with all consciousness, thoughts, and concerns evanishing instantly – offering a glimpse of peace amidst the torment.\n\nYet deep down lies the awareness that such an act doesn't conclude for others; contemplating their reactions – the screams of discovery from loved ones or the devastation left behind – helps restrain these overwhelming suicidal impulses.\n\nDespite harboring intense self-loathing toward myself and the world around me, what truly terrifies me is how much more profound the repercussions may be for others if I were to follow through with these inclinations.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

Despite my attempts to create distance, he persistently touched me. Due to my reserved and socially anxious nature, I didn't speak up.

I had set reaching Friday as my sole motivation - a sign that the ordeal would come to an end. However, even that respite has been extended due to ongoing punishment, prolonging my agony without reprieve.\n\nThe continuous setbacks and punishments have reinforced the belief that I do not deserve joy, only death. Every effort I make feels futile and insignificant as though nothing I do truly matters. The cycle of despair seems unending and insurmountable, pushing me further towards the edge of hopelessness. It is disheartening that even after exerting myself to the maximum extent, it is never deemed enough. The constant dismissal of my struggles and relentless focus on academic performance over my well-being only serves to deepen my desolation.\n\nThe weight of disappointment and neglect bears down heavily on me every day. The lack of support or understanding exacerbates the sense of worthlessness and despair that plagues me relentlessly. It is an isolating experience to grapple with internal turmoil while being met with indifference or punitive measures instead of compassion or genuine assistance. The lack of privacy further compounds this distress, as personal struggles are laid bare for critique without regard for the emotional toll it takes.\n\nEach passing day feels like an arduous journey towards a distant endpoint marked by turning 18, viewed as a potential release from this unending anguish.\n\nThe sense of being a burden and an inherent mistake is suffocating, driving me towards contemplating drastic measures in search of relief from the unrelenting pain that engulfs me daily.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}

Despite knowing these are temporary solutions to my longstanding problems, I have no enjoyment or desire for life whatsoever. It would be appreciated if others could understand and respect this stance.\n\nThere is nothing that holds my interest enough to keep me going. Not only do I struggle with inadequacy in every pursuit, but I lack the motivation to engage with anything the world has to offer.

The thought of enduring this loneliness indefinitely is unbearable, and the prospect of establishing relationships holds no appeal. It is clear that nothing can alter these convictions.\n\nThe notion of waiting decades just to form an acquaintance seems futile; it would seem preferable to end it by jumping off a bridge instead.

Their time limitations are glaringly obvious; after approximately half an hour, there is a palpable sense of urgency to conclude the conversation. Furthermore, discussing suicidal thoughts necessitates careful navigation lest one risks being involuntarily taken into psychiatric care through lines like 'I'm worried about your safety – may I ask about your plans for self-harm?' Should any uncertainty be expressed regarding safety precautions or contemplation of methods, it often results in an immediate transferal into psychiatric evaluation.\"\n\n\"I am currently without a viable means of self-harm, hence why I seek someone who can empathize with my current mental state.

{"prompt":"Feeling a sense of futility. I can already predict someone suggesting that if everything is ultimately without purpose, then the insignificance of it all should be liberating. But that notion offers no comfort. It doesn't inspire me to live carefree and embrace life's uncertainties until my final resting place arrives. I'm tired of society's emphasis on \"having a strong personality\" and being deemed morally upright. It seems like everyone wants you to conform to their expectations. I have no desire to adopt a positive outlook, exude confidence, or display assertiveness - those traits elude me. And even if I did possess them, I wouldn't crave them in the first place. That's my stance. If humans have the ability to shape themselves in any way imaginable, then I advocate for choosing nonexistence altogether. I yearn to be the overlooked pixel that fades away or the puzzle piece lost forever. The fixation on appearances is overwhelmingly disheartening. People invest an exorbitant amount of energy into scrutinizing others' external façades, and it sickens me. Perhaps I should mirror my disdain for humanity by being discourteous towards others. The knowledge of a heavenly realm troubles me deeply; the thought of eternally vanishing is thwarted by an omniscient deity who will not permit such oblivion for me. I am convinced that my demise will arrive by the age of 35, as though it is predestined beyond my current 22 years on this earth - that's as far as my journey extends outwardly.

Oddly, even commercials trigger my sorrow - their every sound and jingle piercing my soul, evoking a melancholy nostalgia I can't quite place.\n\nThe night stretches before me as my first attempt at sober sleep in months beckons dark thoughts of self-harm. The ceaseless chatter in my mind defies rest, plunging me into misery. Does medication hold the key to easing this despair? The thought of becoming numb, bereft of emotions, daunts me. This world feels foreign and unwelcoming; its value and allure elude me.\n\nWhy do we cling so desperately to life's fleeting moments?

Consequently, I find myself abandoned by everyone. The sole person left is someone I met just this April who resides across the Atlantic, with no real-life acquaintances or family by my side. The thought of ending it all on New Year's Eve looms heavily on my mind. Despite having drafted three other suicide notes this year, this one feels definitive.

They all depart eventually, especially those who vowed they wouldn't. There are moments when I ponder if I am the issue. However, the realization hits me that my defense mechanism is to unknowingly distance myself because deep down I expect everyone to leave, leading me to act as if it's better to bring things to an end quickly. For those hesitant about staying, I fail to provide them with a reason to remain. Hence, if given the chance, I would likely walk away myself.

At 23, with no work experience and facing yet another impending academic setback, the weight of loneliness and disillusionment bears heavily on me. While I have a lone companion, my frustration mounts, though unjustly directed at him. He shares his college experiences, underscoring how social connections helped navigate his challenges. It's disheartening to compare his effortless interactions to my isolated routine. The academic path seems bleak as I stumble for the second time. Coping with perpetual anxiety and dread has become debilitating. Mornings serve as poignant reminders of unfulfilled obligations, amplifying my aversion to daytime activities. Despite a decent albeit solitary upbringing by well-meaning family members who provide care, a sense of detachment lingers. The unwillingness to engage persists; even activities once enjoyed like storytelling or reading lose their appeal quickly. Personal hygiene habits wane, reflecting a lack of self-care motivation. The deterioration in dental health due to negligent oral care is distressing yet seemingly insurmountable. Envisioning the future feels futile; thoughts gravitate towards a grim end rather than personal progress or accomplishments – death appears more tangible than functionality in this relentless battle against anxiety and depression. Reflecting on life's trajectory evokes feelings of missed opportunities compared to fortuitous encounters that eluded me. While some assert control over their fortunes, I find myself at odds with such a notion – motivation for change seems elusive without external catalysts or favorable conditions guiding the way towards progress.

Experiencing such a positive shift in my well-being fills me with hope for perpetuating this contentment.

All I truly crave is the acceptance and love of compassionate individuals, guided by unwavering faith in a higher power.\n\n- The convergence of IBS-D and OCD has wrought havoc on my existence, igniting suicidal thoughts as a means to escape this nightmarish reality. Despite its potential comedic undertones, please refrain from mocking my ordeal as every word rings true. Five years ago, at the tender age of 15, this relentless cycle began with incessant diarrhea attacks becoming synonymous with my high school experience. Endless medical evaluations culminated in the diagnosis of IBS-D — an incurable condition that birthed an all-encompassing fear of public embarrassment due to uncontrollable bowel movements. Avoidance became second nature as attending school became an insurmountable feat, leading to academic setbacks and eventual enrollment in a distance education program. Today, at 20, progress has been made on the physical front allowing for pursuit of higher education; however, the emotional scars run deep—haunted by thoughts of squandered youth, isolation, and an unrelenting desire to end it all.\n\n- Nightfall heralds a surge in suicidal ideation that compels me to retire early in hopes of silencing these menacing thoughts momentarily.\n\n- The lasting impact of cyberbullying continues to torment me even a year after enduring cruel taunts like \"shit\" and other degrading monikers on my country's prominent online platform.

To put it simply, I've been a victim of sexual assault, and having my family ignore my ordeal and continue to impose themselves on me only intensifies the feelings of being sexually violated and triggers me on a deep level. The sheer hatred I feel towards this situation is immeasurable. All I desire is to break free from it all, but unfortunately, I sense that this pain will persist for quite some time. I am expected to return to their household until January 19th, and the overwhelming longing for someone to rescue me is consuming me.

The feeling of helplessness in this scenario only serves to amplify the despair within me. All I can think about is ending it all. Furthermore, there are layers upon layers of additional trauma that compound my suffering. My own family has treated me poorly; for instance, while working a low-paying job just to afford dental care, my mother pressured me into buying a car which eventually led to multiple accidents and steep car insurance costs. Meanwhile, my sister, who never pursued higher education and had a menial job at McDonald's that left her feeling somewhat useful but provided her with disposable income for online shopping, seemed to take precedence over my well-being and mental health sacrifices that were made merely for her benefit. My emotions are constantly disregarded; the moment I exhibit even the slightest hint of being burdensome, my mother portrays herself as the victim – wounded by her daughter's alleged betrayal! Despite surviving meningitis and enduring the loss of hearing in one ear while fully conscious during surgery, whenever I express trauma or distress, all she offers is dismissive advice like \"Just relax; you'll be fine\" or shifting blame away from where it rightfully belongs by saying \"Don't blame your father\" when he was clearly at fault. It's disheartening how she refocused attention back on herself even when I tried bringing up abusive behavior from my older sister's boyfriend towards both myself and my nephew while enabling such toxicity within our family dynamic. There is an overwhelming sense of injustice in various aspects of my life - at school, being encompassed by an extremely leftist social justice warrior culture (whereas I consider myself more moderately left), constantly subjected to collective guilt-tripping based on race or social categories (\"You're white; therefore you're complicit and must educate yourself!\") It becomes exhausting trying to explain why such attitudes are toxic especially when engaging with younger individuals who seem enclosed in their own ideological bubble.\nMy experiences have deprived me of any semblance of a normal life; inevitably worsened by familial circumstances where due to early retirement decisions from my father leaving little financial stability resulting in limitations on pursuing higher education opportunities as initially planned.\nI remained loyal throughout it all as requested by my mother but endured unimaginable torment as a consequence of that sacrifice.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

To be completely honest, at the age of 15, I ingested 120 extra-strength aspirin pills with the intention of causing my own death after reading on WebMD that it could be fatal. I recall being yelled at, struck, experiencing hearing loss, losing my ability to stand, and the subsequent visit to the hospital. At 21, I bought a gun, inexperienced with firearms. Despite conducting thorough research on where to aim for a fatal shot to my head, the fear of pain overwhelmed me. After loading a round into the chamber and realizing the slide wasn't fully forward, I hesitated upon pulling the trigger again due to extreme nerve-wracking apprehension. Concerned individuals sought me out as they recognized I posed a danger to myself, which ultimately led to my hospitalization.\n\nMore recently, I acquired a rope sturdy enough to support my weight for what I thought would be a partial suspension hanging. Confident in my knowledge of positioning the noose correctly, I carried out the plan in seclusion. However, despite tightening it and leaning into it as instructed, all I experienced was excruciating pressure in my head without any signs of losing consciousness. My face turned purple from burst blood vessels but realizing that full hanging entailed unbearable suffering made me abandon that method.\n\nNowadays, I am set up with an exit bag that I meticulously prepared without feeling anything – much like how I approach various situations in life lately.

Turning off the gas left me in a state of shock without knowing how to process my emotions.

{"prompt":"Why hasn't technology advanced enough to take me to a world tailored to my desires? Today marks my birthday, yet I feel empty inside. There's an expectation for happiness and celebration, but all I feel is a profound sadness as I navigate another day where expressing my true emotions is not permitted. Birthdays have become superficial occasions, merely a chance for acquaintances and family to congratulate themselves on their niceties and remembrances. It's been several years, perhaps four or five, since I last genuinely enjoyed a birthday, back when I was around 11 years old. Lasting joy seems elusive to me. Why do others assume that everything in my life is perfect? I push myself tirelessly, almost to the point of self-destruction, aiming for admission into an Ivy League institution as a means of escaping my parents and this unsatisfying country and town. If only there was someone who truly understood me without fear of judgment – not the facade I present to the world, but the raw reality of who I am. Unfortunately, such individuals only exist in my imagination. I indulge in fantasies of love and acceptance from an idealized family, but the harsh reality of my actual circumstances hits hard. It's reached a point where my struggles don't seem severe enough to warrant genuine sympathy or horror from others; instead, they gnaw at me insidiously. I detest this state of affairs. I'm well aware that others endure greater hardships than mine, which makes me feel pathetic for shedding tears over my own troubles like some kind of weakling. Why can't I rise above this? How did fate choose me to be stuck in this agonizing middle ground? All I yearn for is to exist long enough to escape into a realm where my flaws – physical and otherwise – vanish, where all my desires are fulfilled, and where I'm not plagued by a sense of moral inadequacy. The desire to simply cease existing grows stronger within me. No one in my circle comprehends the depths of who I am; when they catch glimpses of it, they recoil in fear.

Days slip by as I remain holed up in my room lost in elaborate daydreams about activities that could be easily brought to life. Painting, reading, writing – I possess all the necessary tools yet find myself unable to act. My mind is filled with elaborate scenarios, including a captivating girl I once glimpsed, whom I have idealized into a deep imaginary connection. Progress seems sluggish despite my attempts at engaging more each day; the specter of passivity and mediocrity looms large over my existence. As these thoughts swirl in my head, a sense of unworthiness fuels suicidal thoughts. Though my desire is not death but rather a vibrant life, rooted in a fear of insignificance. Politics captivate me, stirring aspirations of activism and envisioning impactful changes for the world; yet I falter at the first steps like participating in important protests. My struggles academically leave me doubting my intelligence despite past test scores indicating otherwise; overwhelmed by peers whom I perceive as intellectually superior.

Our friendship dissolved because of my involvement in the furry community, and I have been unable to find solace since then. The love and longing for him are overwhelming, making life unbearable, and the desire to bring it all to an end is consuming me, even though I am mindful of not causing pain to others. When I attempted to confide in my friends, their reactions ranged from dismissing the topic due to their anxiety triggers to bluntly asking me to move on and labeling suicide as a selfish act. Their failure to empathize or understand the depth of my suffering has left me feeling isolated and misunderstood, reinforcing my decision not to seek help anymore. It feels as though my world is crumbling apart, and I regret ever disclosing my feelings or true self, believing that things would have been different if he hadn't discovered my involvement in the furry community. Self-loathing consumes me entirely. I yearn for an escape where I could start anew with none of this baggage weighing me down if I were to end my life.

The urge to cry is constant, but the tears won't come, and I don't have anyone close enough to confide in and truly understand me. Even if I could articulate it, which is doubtful given my own confusion about my emotions. If I were to try to explain it, it's like there's this endless void inside me, lurking just behind my eyes. Nothing sparks my interest anymore, nothing holds any significance. Anger is my prevailing emotion. The struggle with old wounds seems insurmountable. Dealing with nerve damage is agonizing. My aspirations were snatched away from me before I could even pursue them. Deep within me, there lies an intense mix of sorrow, fury, and resentment but it feels obscured behind a hazy barrier. I attempt introspection but all I see are my physical flaws, the aging of my body robbing me of vigor before I could revel in my youth. Will things ever improve? And how in the world can I begin to mend myself? Suicide creeps into my thoughts daily; at times, contemplating that escape provides a strange comfort that propels me forward. All I crave is some time alone - maybe out in the desert with a cup of coffee. While practical methods cross my mind like using a gun or preparing an emergency bag, the idea most alluring is lighting myself on fire after dousing in gasoline. There's this urge within me to showcase the depth of pain I've endured; call me selfish if you must but all I seek is an opportunity to heal myself and rediscover slivers of joy once more.

Currently, I find myself on a work placement, and as the end of this six-month period approaches, the uncertainty about my future intensifies. I feel ill-equipped for what lies ahead, grappling with the demands of securing references for job applications and constantly presenting my best self in professional settings - a feat that seems beyond my reach despite repeated attempts. Even the thought of facing an interview fills me with dread. The relentless cycle of feeling inadequate for positions I apply to, compounded by the harsh reality of financial pressures in a pricey economy like that of the UK, pushes me to tears easily. Standing up for myself in situations where I am treated unfairly proves to be a challenge, as such instances seem all too common. The mundane task of preparing for work daily only adds to my sense of suffocation within this competitive environment - it's like being trapped in an endless race with no way out except through thoughts of self-harm. While I acknowledge other underlying issues, my current preoccupation revolves around financial struggles and the perceived lack of intellect or recognition from others. My tendency to lack initiative coupled with poor memory retention further feeds into my feelings of worthlessness. This general disinterest in anything further accentuates my inability to communicate professionally despite efforts to learn from instructional materials and observations. The difficulty in articulating responses formally during discussions often leaves me flustered and humiliated due to pauses in speech. The emptiness that pervades me seems all-encompassing, leaving me feeling utterly crushed as life's challenges continue to mount with each passing year at 22, heightening my fear and sense of vulnerability. Despite contemplations about taking drastic actions like hanging myself, the actual execution remains beyond my reach thus far. Turning to online platforms periodically becomes an outlet for expressing my grievances about existence and its unforgiving nature; recently enduring belittlement from a colleague only adds fuel to this fire of isolation I experience without forming meaningful connections or cultivating friendships due to personal limitations. While not actively seeking companionship, I can't help but recognize its potential impact on my well-being given my socially awkward nature and hypersensitivity. Reflecting on the injustices rampant in society - from wicked individuals and monetary pressures to unrelenting job expectations and harsh judgments alongside tragic acts of violence - only reinforces thoughts about seeking an escape route from this chaos; alas, the sheer lack of resolve hinders any decisive action on my part towards that end.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

Being here makes me want to disappear; I question why I visit when it only reinforces my desire not to exist. I feel utterly alone. I'm exhausted. A debilitating migraine is intensifying all these emotions further. Clearly, there are deeper issues at play beyond this incident, so why has this specific event pushed me past my breaking point? It sounds ridiculous. I shouldn't be feeling like this or getting upset over something as trivial as the kitten situation. It infuriates me that they believe locking up the kittens is beneficial - trying forcibly induce a sense of security when it took three weeks for them even start feeling safe around me; it's been only two days with our parents.\nI've spent countless hours trying to make sense of everything happening in my life right now and yet there seems no solution or escape in sight. I wish I could just rest for now but sleep eludes me; instead, all I yearn for is disappearance – not wanting existence anymore. Apologies for this rambling outpouring of emotions; consumed by anger and despair at this moment, venting felt necessary.”\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

Experiencing the loss of someone so close to me for the first time has made me appreciate life in a way I never have before.

Since returning to my native country, Romania, two years ago, I have been overwhelmed by stress, primarily stemming from school in 2019. Back then, I found it hard to make friends, and many nights I would cry myself to sleep. Even activities that used to bring me joy became dull, and thoughts of ending my own life crossed my mind several times. However, the love I have for my little brother has been my anchor through it all; he is the sole reason I am still here. Things started looking up a bit during the pandemic. Although anxiety still weighed heavily on me, having a friend who would listen and support me made a significant difference.\n\nI am reaching out now because everything has taken a turn for the worse lately. Stress and anxiety have become paralyzing, leaving me with no drive to do anything. Additionally, last year I realized that I am atheist and bisexual. The challenge is that my family and friends are deeply religious. When I came out to my only friend a few weeks back, he began distancing himself from me. He was the one person with whom I felt safe and connected regularly.\n\nAll these emotions are bottled up inside of me, and the fear of being dismissed with phrases like 'it’s just a phase' or 'you're young; what could you possibly be stressed about?' looms large if I were to confide in someone familiar. As schools prepare to resume in-person classes amidst rigorous expectations due to our time in online schooling, the pressure seems insurmountable.\n\nI am struggling immensely and feeling utterly lost because there doesn't seem to be any place where I can seek help or solace.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

The bully has not only been targeting my friend relentlessly but has also gone to the extent of making hurtful remarks such as suggesting she should end her life and threatening her with violent language. This individual has repeatedly body-shamed my friend in various ways and even fabricated images of her engaging in fake conversations, presumably to defame her. Despite my friend's clear request for peace, the harassment persists, now stretching over 5 days. The aggressor has resorted to creating 17 Instagram accounts, 7 phone numbers, and 2 Facebook profiles solely for the purpose of tormenting her. This relentless attack is taking a toll on my friend's mental well-being; she is feeling drained and reluctant to partake in daily activities. While I'm encouraging her to take care of herself and engage in positive experiences, she is struggling and seems overwhelmed by the repeated assaults. It’s disheartening that she feels powerless since the authorities have advised against any direct response.

Encumbered with an unusual eye condition that my family fails to comprehend, hindering my ability to drive. Likely having experienced ADHD since childhood, indicated by numerous signals then and now. However, my family dismisses mental health issues as fictitious constructs, attributing depression and related struggles to idleness and immaturity. My brother perceives me as devoid of guilt or remorse for what he deems laziness. Ironically, my mind incessantly administers doses of guilt and shame to reinforce the notion that I am trapped in misery. I harbor intense self-loathing for my past actions, current state, and every future misstep because I believe I am inherently flawed and unlikable. Even my closest companion withdrew due to my depressive state, disliking the somber atmosphere I emanate.

The overwhelming desire to escape from this existence is consuming me. The only glimmer of happiness I envision is through ending my own life. Various methods cross my mind, but at this point, the method is inconsequential as long as it achieves the desired outcome. Thoughts of crashing to the ground or plunging from a bridge into the water offer a strange sense of comfort. The morning light brings with it a stark reminder of my unrelenting presence in this world, amplifying the agony within me. Each day feels like an eternity of internal anguish, leaving me drained and hopeless. Maybe today will be the day when I finally summon the courage to go through with it.\n\nIn the depths of my despair, even falling from great heights no longer inspires fear but rather promises some bizarre form of solace.

Perhaps a different route home after work could provide an opportunity for final liberation—whether by hanging myself or succumbing inside a totaled car.\n\nScouring for isolated spots where I could disappear without a trace has become a morbid fixation. Death appears impartial in its embrace; whether by rope, pills, or some other means, as long as I make my intentions clear and see them through, perhaps some semblance of peace can be found in oblivion. The idea of being free from existence holds an odd allure—the ultimate release from all earthly burdens.\n\nAmidst these dark thoughts lurks uncertainty about whether I will truly go through with these drastic actions or if they will remain mere fantasies left unexplored until time reveals my ultimate decision. Living feels like an unbearable weight that grows heavier every time consciousness returns.\n\nDespite being surrounded by beauty, the urge to end everything persists relentlessly within me.

Oh, how appealing it would be to craft the perfect noose and execute one final act that defies all pain and suffering.\n\nIn these moments where death beckons seductively within reach, even dreams seem tainted by reminders of unbearable reality upon awakening—each morning brings renewed longing for escape.\n\nI yearn for the release that only hanging myself could bring—a twisted reassurance that peace lies within such finality if carried out meticulously...\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

No one showed any interest in talking to me, not even the peers my age. Instead, they were engrossed in drinking and engaging in public displays of affection in the pool while the grown-ups laughed and enjoyed karaoke. I felt marginalized and invisible, and when I withdrew from the scene for the night, no one bothered to check on me. The whole ordeal set off a chain reaction of emotions within me. I felt utterly neglected, their glances filled with nothing but pity. It grated on me how they only made an effort to involve me in discussions when prompted by the adults. The instant the adults weren't around, it was as if my voice no longer mattered.\n\nThe environment became overwhelming to a degree that led me to seclude myself in the bathroom for an entire hour because of the excessive noise.

The envy I harbor towards those leading ordinary lives inevitably morphs into disdain, fueling my detestation towards anyone diminishing my humanity, leaving me to wallow in a sense of being subhuman - a fact I've come to accept. My perceived worthlessness and ineptitude have woven a narrative wherein failure is my only expertise. Strangely, were I truly thoughtless, perhaps these feelings wouldn't weigh so heavily on me. At times, I fantasize about the bliss of ignorance so profound that the world remains an enigma to me, finding solace in the simplicity of happiness derived from little joys. Nonetheless, this doesn't equate to a desire for ignorance; no one truly yearns for that.\n\nSimilarly ensnared by envy yet resistant to conforming to societal norms, it's almost as if I am synonymous with this suffering; it's become an integral part of my identity that I'm hesitant to relinquish.

There’s an acute awareness that childhood, adolescence - experiences common to many - are realms forever beyond my reach.

In seeking refuge through indulging in junk food consumption – akin to self-medication – fleeting moments of solace are attempted but quickly dissolved by self-loathing episodes that replay day after day. The vice-grip of addiction renders me captive while outsiders fail to comprehend the gravity of this internal struggle; all they see is indulgence rather than dependency akin to substance abuse.\n\nMired in self-hatred bordering on self-destructive tendencies coupled with mounting financial woes exacerbates the relentless despair coursing through me daily.

Consequently, my father and even my sister now harbor resentment towards me for causing distress to our mother.

Despite attempting therapy, I find myself unable to articulate the depth of my emotions to the therapist due to the overwhelming pain it stirs within me. Self-loathing consumes me as I perceive myself as a constant source of mistakes that only serve to worsen everyone else's lives. The weight of it all has led me to a breaking point where I feel unable to continue.

Despite attempting to confide in friends, their reactions have been dismissive and insensitive, further adding to my distress.\n\nThe responses I received ranged from \"Can we please avoid discussing him? It triggers my anxiety,\" to \"Just move on and stop fixating on him!\" or \"Suicide is selfish; don't be weak,\" and even \"He's not worth your time.\" These reactions have discouraged me from seeking help as it seems like my friends cannot comprehend the depth of my suffering. It feels like my world is crumbling around me, and I regret ever opening up about this situation, wishing that he never discovered my interest in being a furry to prevent this turmoil.\n\nThe desire to end my life stems from a yearning for an alternate reality where none of these painful events occurred. It is disheartening that despite exhibiting signs of profound distress, my friends failed to recognize the severity of my inner turmoil. Thank you for taking the time to read this; it provided a much-needed outlet for me to express my emotions.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

The constant fear of embarrassing accidents in front of classmates due to frequent bathroom visits led to severe anxiety, making it impossible for me to attend school or be around people. Despite eventually enrolling in a distance education program and now being 20 years old with improvements in managing my condition enough to pursue college, the weight of these experiences has left me feeling like my life has been irreparably damaged.

{"prompt":"I am currently experiencing ongoing suffering and don't see an end in sight. I come from a toxic family environment where my parents exhibit a lack of love and disregard for my emotions. Although attempting to mend ties with my sister has shown improvement, I still feel overwhelmingly dreadful. I strongly suspect that the lingering effects of abuse have led to some form of PTSD and generalized anxiety taking residence within me. Physical health issues have surfaced, which my therapist attributes to my anxiety levels. The sense of isolation and neglect is profound. It feels like a certainty that affection will forever elude me, leaving me feeling like an insignificant presence in the world. Tears flow as I write this, yearning for companionship in a non-romantic sense, someone to share life with and grow old together, even if it means facing the possibility of loss. Either individuals walk away upon witnessing my vulnerabilities or choose to exploit them, forcing me to sever ties with them. Why do I feel so abandoned? My attempts at seeking solace in faith have helped somewhat but were initially overshadowed by immense emotional pain. Even during moments of stillness like playing games or delving into books, all I sense is tension and agony coursing through me. It seems that nobody is willing to lend an ear without a monetary exchange. While my therapist provides a non-judgmental listening ear, the reality remains that without payment, I'd be utterly alone. She encourages living in the moment, yet when I attempt to do so, it feels as though I'm trapped at the bottom of a desolate pit. Ever since enduring my father's abuse, I've carried the weight of feeling like an outsider and harbor fears of forever being labeled as such. Longing for love permeates every fiber of my being - yearning for comforting embraces, reassuring words about my worthiness and intelligence while being told that everything will eventually be okay. My existence currently hinges on fragile threads as I desperately search for fragments of joy in this world reminiscent of simpler times from my youth. However, each time I confront my inner demons head-on, they ruthlessly attempt to engulf me entirely. The thought lingers that the world would remain unchanged if I were no longer present; already fading into forgotten memories for those who have crossed paths with me thus far.

I harbor envy for those considered normal, a sentiment that breeds bitterness. Frankly, I detest anyone who diminishes my humanity, perpetuating my sense of subhuman worthlessness. After all, I am inept, slothful, and devoid of capability - a master in fumbling through life's challenges. If only I were simpleminded enough not to care; ignorance seems like a blissful state where trivial joys could thrive naturally. Nevertheless, that doesn't mean I yearn for idiocy; nobody would.\n\nSimilarly, I covet what others possess but reject the notion of becoming like them. This agony seems inseparable from me; an entity I'm unwilling to part ways with. The desire to intensify my suffering lurks within me. To be scorned and ridiculed seems fitting - a loser, an outcast, a continuous series of letdowns. In the lonely night hours, the sense of isolation weighs heavily on me; yet reaching out is out of the question as disdain colors my view of humanity. Embracing fear becomes necessary; every negative emotion must find its place. I should endure sharp pains and regurgitate despair - pain; it's all I yearn for.\n\n\"Now What?. Hope was never part of my story anyhow.

They say childhood is a one-time deal; those joyful adolescent years will forever evade my grasp. At times, self-loathing creeps in; an overwhelming emptiness blankets my being as if those formative years slipped by unnoticed.\n\nI feel as though every day presents an unbearable heaviness that refuses to dissipate—a constant burden unique to me alone. The option of escapism tempts me - lying back with junk food giving respite momentarily feels enticing on occasion despite knowing it fuels self-hatred at its core - trapping myself in this cycle day after day. Eating becomes more chore than pleasure; perusing aisles at the store yields nothing but forced consumption driven by obligation rather than appetite.\n\nThe weight of self-loathing presses down on me relentlessly as financial worries add further strain to my already heavy load.\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" in"}

{"prompt":"What happened to me has left me struggling. It all started about 7 months ago when I, a 17-year-old, visited a friend's lake house in April. While innocently playing on a tire swing only about 2 feet off the ground, I had a sudden fall directly onto my back. Initially, I didn't notice any significant changes, but that night I began feeling unwell and fatigued. The following days brought a sense of being slightly off, with a persistent foggy and fuzzy sensation in my head.\n\nAfter about a week, upon consulting my regular doctor, the diagnosis was swift – a concussion. As time went by without any improvement in symptoms, I sought the opinion of a neurologist who attributed my condition to post-concussion syndrome. Oddly enough, unlike the typical symptoms associated with concussions, all I experienced was this ongoing fogginess in my head.\n\nIn search of relief, I turned to a chiropractor without success. Throughout the end of summer, despite attempting to relax through golfing, things took a turn for the worse. The once-constant brain fog transformed into an uncomfortable sensation akin to having hot water coursing through my head. Feeling increasingly distressed, I sought help from a naturopathic doctor specializing in natural remedies who held promise in alleviating my symptoms.\n\nMultiple scans such as MRI, x-rays, and CT scans were performed on various parts of my body while consultations at concussion clinics yielded no fruitful results. Even trying CBD oil at my mother's suggestion backfired as it exacerbated the inflammation within my head.\n\nSubsequently advised by another naturopathic practitioner to consult vision specialists and undergo neurotransmitter testing revealed no alarming issues except for low vitamin D levels and markedly elevated cortisol levels presumably triggered by acute stress or anxiety. This led me to start taking Cymbalta gradually increasing doses from 30mg to 60mg and then back down to 30mg but with little relief.\n\nFeelings of hopelessness have crept in as nothing seems to alleviate my suffering despite numerous attempts including supplements for vitamin D deficiency which proved futile against the constant discomfort characterized by tightness in facial muscles, stiff neck, tension around temples and sensations resembling moving or zapping around my head and temples.\n\nMy most distressing symptom remains the intense heat and inflammation within my head coupled with an unsettling sensation of movement. Surprisingly, temporary relief is found when exposed to extreme cold like snow or icy environments or through cold showers – albeit short-lived as symptoms resurface once more leaving me perplexed as to what steps should be taken next.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" in"}

{"prompt":"I was reported as missing, which took me by surprise since I hadn't even been gone for 24 hours before people started getting concerned. Despite leaving a note explaining things, the attention is overwhelming. A contact informed me that I've been removed from the missing persons list as I appear stable and out of harm's way. However, my family is incessantly calling and messaging me, but I'm not in the mood to engage with anyone right now. I'm just lying in bed at the hotel, planning to try sleeping soon.\n\nMy mind is filled with conflicting emotions at the moment. It's like I have a part of me that wants to go through with my plan, but another part that hesitates. It's frustrating, especially since I can't rent a car without a credit card if it's out of state. So, I had to clear my card balance last night and now waiting for it to update so I can use it. Not feeling up for going out in the city, so staying put in bed seems like the best option for now.\n\nEveryone suddenly seems overly concerned since things have taken a turn for the worse. I understand their worry, but each day feels like an internal struggle that's becoming unbearable. All I desire is solitude to end it all – away from public places and people. It always seems there's someone trying to intervene just when you feel like giving up.\n\nMy ex-wife blocked me after discovering a video of her engaging in inappropriate behavior while we were together. Now her family is reaching out to me, adding to the chaos. Tomorrow, I plan on renting a car and heading out to a remote location to carry out my plan.\n\nAnticipation and anxiety are consuming me while awaiting Monday's arrival. The ex has blocked me after seeing the video that struck a nerve with her. \n\nI bid farewell to my daughters; I reassured my eldest that my love for them will endure forever. Contemplating whether or not to share the video with my ex’s mother adds another layer of complexity before Monday arrives.\n\nEverything seems lined up – hotel booked, flight scheduled, car rental confirmed – yet the waiting feels excruciatingly long, resembling endless days passing by slowly.\n\nThe series of unfortunate events continues as past scars resurface upon an unexpected discovery involving my ex-partner’s infidelity. The realization hits hard as signs previously disregarded now point clearly towards her unfaithfulness.\n\nAs this chapter closes, amid sleepless nights and escalating circumstances, decisions are made – resignation messages sent and final preparations put in place before bidding goodbye.\n\nTo those who have supported me along this journey, your words are deeply appreciated as I navigate these turbulent waters alone. As this marks my final communication here, take care all and may you find strength to battle your own demons within you.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}
{"prompt":"What keeps me hanging onto hope, really? Looking back at my entire history, it seems crystal clear that happiness was never meant for me. I've learned the hard way not to let myself hope or get excited about anything because disappointment always follows. Achieving my goals seems like a distant dream I'll never reach. Spare me the clichéd reassurances that things will magically improve; I've been through enough disappointments to know better. People say time heals all wounds and such, but that's just empty words. The urge to end it all grows stronger. Each time I dare to hope, the eventual letdown cuts even more deeply. If only I could numb my emotions somehow and settle for whatever little life throws my way. My upbringing was a nightmare – bullied by so-called friends and physically abused by my own parents, teaching me not to trust any soul, not even those closest to me because they are capable of betrayal and inflicting pain if you don't conform to their standards. I can't even trust myself; after all, I'm the architect of my own misery. I've committed awful deeds too – bullying others just to feel a sense of power. It's ironic how much like those very friends and family members I despise so much, I've become. Perhaps this misery is exactly what I deserve. But why don't my \"friends\" suffer as well then? Maybe it's time they felt some agony caused by me instead. To add insult to injury, no woman has ever shown interest in me. Yes, it's pathetic that it bothers me this much, but it runs deeper than just physical intimacy for me; finding companionship has never been easy for me like it seems to be for others who once ridiculed me over being a virgin until I started lying about it just to fit in with them – because friends are nothing but manipulative leeches in the end; you depend on them to escape loneliness yet have to mold yourself into someone you're not just to avoid their ridicule. The thought of a woman genuinely caring for someone like me feels like a cruel joke at this point in life. Oh how I sometimes wish I were asexual to sidestep these complexities altogether! As for family, what does that really mean anyway? You exist purely out of two people's primal desires coming together momentarily without much forethought nor planning on how to raise you adequately after bringing you into this world? Sure, they love me in their own twisted way – using beatings as discipline when failing at basic tasks seemed justified at the time; should gratitude be my response? And oh yes, should I also express gratitude knowing they'll likely cast me off one day simply because my beliefs differ from their indoctrinated religious views? Unconditional love? That's pure fiction – conditional upon blind obedience is more accurate! Rather than succumb to anyone – be it friends demanding conformity, family dictating expectations, or women setting unreachable standards – death appears increasingly appealing as an escape from this cycle of torment and disillusionment! What flicker of hope is left when pondering the values clung onto dearly like family whose legacy perpetuated unwanted life lessons and rejection or friends whose ridicule masks their own insecurities projected upon your vulnerability or love personified by rejections with superior suitors leaving a void seemingly insurmountable? Seriously... what does one do with this muck called existence when any trace of meaning fades into oblivion'Maybe the end looms nearer than anticipated...\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

The past few weeks have tested me beyond measure, and the aftermath has hit me even harder. My attempts to persevere only seem to make things increasingly chaotic.

{"prompt":"I have put together an exit bag. For the first time, the idea of taking my own life really terrifies me. Let me be completely honest. When I was 15, I ingested 120 extra strength aspirin pills with the intent to end my life. According to WebMD, it was a potentially lethal amount. I recall being scolded, hit, losing my hearing, losing my ability to stand, and the subsequent hospital visit. At 21, I acquired a gun. It was my first experience handling one. After extensive research, I pinpointed where to aim it at my head to ensure I wouldn't fall into the category of the \"fortunate few\" who survive a gunshot wound to the head. The thought of the pain frightened me; even after loading a round into the chamber, I failed to notice that the slide wasn't fully forward by about half an inch. When I pulled the trigger, nothing happened. The fear of pain overwhelmed me so much that upon recognizing my error, I couldn't bring myself to pull the trigger again. Concerned individuals were searching for me and were aware of the danger I posed to myself, eventually leading to my hospitalization.\n\nMore recently, I bought rope sturdy enough to support my weight although I hoped it wouldn't need to. After researching partial suspension hanging techniques and ensuring proper noose placement and execution, I retreated to a secluded spot and followed through with my plan. However tightly I secured it and however much pressure I applied leaning into it, all that ensued was intense pain and head pressure without any signs of losing consciousness emerging. Defeated, my face turned purple from bursting blood vessels all over under the strain. The thought of undergoing a complete hanging seemed unbearably painful for me.\n\nToday marks another method in place with an exit bag arranged meticulously; while setting it up felt void of emotion just as it has for some time now in any life scenario due to my lifelong depression shifting into depersonalization over this past year, rendering me incredibly empty inside.\n\nYet when I turned that gas valve today, panic gripped me as it hissed out much louder than expected right next to my ear causing an unexpected ache in my chest even though theoretically there should be no pain involved according to what's intended; therefore shutting off the gas supply abruptly left me in a state of shock with conflicting emotions swirling within.\n\nAt this juncture, confusion prevails within me as certainty characterizes this method as foolproof when executed correctly (as has been done) yet coming face-to-face with the reality that there's not a single person left in my life whom I could pen down some cliché suicide note for stings with an odd sense of finality creeping in on me.\n\nStruggling with this weight for so long has led me into a relentless dance between wishing for death until finally becoming numb towards everything; now that it's right here within grasp leaves me oscillating between isolation and apprehension whilst feeling lost amidst solitude which is exacerbated by sheer fatigue both mentally and emotionally.\n\nI'm not entirely sure what exactly prompted this outpouring or if there is anything specific that can assuage these conflicting apprehensions circling within - duality between succumbing fear of failure against an equally overwhelming dread of death swirls around within leaving behind a trail of sorrow over past actions either unwittingly or deliberately driving away those scarce individuals who were once part of my life.\n\nThe pervasive sensation of loneliness coupled with sheer weariness weighs heavily upon me at present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}

Tears threaten to overflow constantly, but they somehow never come, and I lack the closeness with anyone who could understand my turmoil. Trying to articulate my emotions feels futile; it's like there's a profound emptiness within me that no longer finds joy or purpose in anything. Fury simmers under the surface constantly, fueled by past traumas that seem insurmountable - especially the torment of nerve damage robbing me of my dreams.

My battle with severe depression has intensified recently, and it's been a lifelong struggle for me. Each day, I carry the weight of regret for my past choices and errors, feeling like a terrible person. My emotional instability and anxiety have sabotaged nearly all my relationships, leaving me full of shame when reflecting on my past conduct. Losing so many friends in the past year has amplified my sense of isolation, especially now that I've graduated college and find it difficult to maintain connections. Unemployment has further isolated me, as I grapple with the shame and depression that haunt me daily. The daily struggle to keep going feels like a lonely battle, with my family expressing concern, particularly my mother, while I withdraw into the confines of my room.

Despite my efforts to seek help and heal, things are still tough. Adding to this, as an immigrant, my native land is not safe for me at all. I'm currently awaiting a decision on my appeal to stay in a safer place, which I'll find out next month. The constant onslaught of flashbacks, prolonged panic attacks, nightmares, along with difficulties in eating and sleeping has been relentless for an extended period.

Despite leaving behind an abusive ex-partner, I find myself unable to resist the urge to stalk them. This behavior is clearly wrong as it amounts to harassment which mirrors what my abusers inflicted on me; a vicious cycle that feels impossible to break. My mind relentlessly fixates on them despite my best efforts to keep occupied and refrain from bothering them - each attempt ending in failure. The lengths I've gone through just underscore the suffering I'm causing this individual.\n\nLooking ahead, if my stay in a secure location isn't assured and improvement in my mental well-being doesn't materialize by the end of February, I have made plans to end my life. The fear of being physically unsafe again coupled with the lack of access to necessary treatment for my inner turmoil make it unbearable for me to continue this way. Regrettably, it seems that regardless of how hard I try, my actions are inadvertently hurting those close to me; hence the decision not just for myself but also for their sake.

It seems like everyone here is working against me, and that's why I'm stuck in this situation. People can be so disappointing. All I truly crave right now is to experience joy and affection. Just those two things are all I yearn for presently. The idea of taking my own life before I hit 22 might sound nonsensical, but to me, it's a way of sparing my future self from further disappointments. I don't want to end up as a 30-year-old who never learned to drive, never had a significant other, never had a father figure, never shared a kiss, or as a person in their 40s still subjected to bullying. The thought of being a 21-year-old with receding hairline seems bad enough, but at least this version of myself would be spared from witnessing any more failures or having children witness such despair. Imagining myself at 50 and still inexperienced in intimacy or at 60 without ever owning a home or at 70 devoid of grandchildren is simply disheartening. Yet another despondent evening plagued by intense anxiety and depression ensues. Damn you and you too! No, damn you! And you too, OCD – yes, you're included! And depression, well, screw you as well! In all honesty though, these struggles seem unending even with the medications I've tried. Despite experimenting with so many options, perhaps there are more out there that could alleviate my anxiety and depression if given a chance. Earlier today while out for a stroll, I encountered two charming girls but couldn't muster the courage to speak to them; now I'm engulfed by self-loathing and drowning in negative thoughts which might just lead me to tears soon enough. Please excuse me – sometimes my emotions get the best of me. It feels like being myself is never sufficient; people seem to appreciate me more when things are going wrong in my life than when they're going well – what kind of paradox is that? Success seems to breed contempt from others; every time I disconnect from social media apps, that's precisely when all the notifications flood in – it's as if they would hardly notice if I ceased to exist altogether. My depression and rage are escalating by the day while remnants of anxiety persist within me.

I've learned the hard way not to get my hopes up or feel excitement because nothing ever improves, and reaching my dreams seems impossible. Spare me the false reassurances that things will magically improve. I've been struggling for so long. People keep telling me to be patient and all that nonsense, but let's be real here. I'm at a point where death seems inviting. Each time I dare to hope for something, the disappointment cuts even deeper when it inevitably falls through. If only I knew how to numb my emotions, so I could accept whatever scraps life throws my way. My early years were a nightmare; perhaps that explains why I'm such a mess now. Friends bullied me, and my parents were anything but nurturing; it's made me believe that no one can be trusted – not even those closest to you will stand by you if you don't bend to their will. Trusting myself is out of the question; I am the architect of my own downfall, responsible for some unforgivable actions in the past, like bullying others to mask my own insecurities. It appears fitting that I should be plagued by suffering, yet why don't all those so-called \"friends\" endure the same fate? Maybe it's time they faced some consequences at my hands. No woman has ever shown an interest in me either. Yes, it may seem pathetic that I'm upset over romantic rejection, but it runs deeper than just physical intimacy for me – forming connections is a struggle beyond what others understand, with ridicule hurled at me regarding my virginity making matters worse. So, I resorted to fabricating stories about my experiences to save face among friends – who are no more than manipulative leeches one needs around solely to stave off solitude; yet conformity is demanded in their presence unless you desire more torment. The idea of a woman genuinely liking me feels like a cruel joke by now; if only I could exist without these romantic entanglements altogether as an asexual person does. Family holds no significance; your mere existence hinges on two individuals deciding to procreate – while they claim affection for me, any punishments inflicted were mere disciplinary measures meant for my own good supposedly and what ensued after failing simple tasks like tying shoelaces was merely \"tough love,\" right? So should gratitude be expected in return? Am I also expected to appreciate being shunned in the future for refusing their indoctrinated beliefs? Love with strings attached isn't love at all—it's coercion; submission is expected at every turn which makes death appear more appealing than surrendering myself to anyone: friends, family, potential partners—none of them hold any appeal anymore.\n\nSo tell me: What reason do I have left to endure this cesspool called life? Family—those who brought me into this world only to falter in raising me properly? Friends—the ones who tormented and urge conformity upon me? Love—the concept embodied by watching those coveted girls find solace in others better suited than myself? This existence feels closer to its end than planned…\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

My ex once made promises of unwavering support through thick and thin, but those words faded when faced with adversity. This betrayal has left me utterly disillusioned. It seems every time I extend trust, it results in betrayal and heartbreak. Such naivety on my part astounds me. Humanity itself seems flawed beyond redemption.

Nothing captivates me anymore; nothing carries real significance. Anger consumes me constantly. The inability to overcome past traumas baffles me. Dealing with nerve damage is beyond dreadful. Every aspiration was ripped away from me - leaving me with an overwhelming mix of grief, fury, and resentment buried deep inside my mind; as if obscured by a hazy reflection in the mirror. Despite trying to confront it, all that meets my gaze is my distorted posture, witnessing my body aging and declining prematurely before truly experiencing my youth. When will any of this begin to improve -- and please God, how can I mend it on my own? Thoughts of taking my own life occupy my mind every day.

How can I stop being a coward and stand firm when faced with such thoughts? I desperately want to avoid this path but feel like it's all that remains for me now.

{"prompt":"I had a disturbing dream where a group of unknown men, who seemed to be foreigners, were committing mass murder almost casually. Strangely, I have no personal issues with men or people from other countries, but the dream felt incredibly real and left me in a state of intense panic when I woke up. In my dream, these men stormed a familiar school I know of, around five of them slashing at anyone in sight as they scattered throughout the building causing chaos. The sense of fear and urgency in the dream was overwhelming. Seeking safety, I fled to what appeared to be my actual home, only for the nightmare to continue as some of them invaded my home and went on a violent rampage. I abruptly woke up at this point, but the terror lingered even after I was awake. I am puzzled as to why such a vivid and terrifying dream would occur. It has left me anxious about sleeping again due to the intensity of these dreams.

{"prompt":"1. I feel completely drained, devoid of life and spirit, with no relief in sight. I'm fed up with the facade of professional help being a universal remedy – it just doesn't work for me. The weight of being a virgin sometimes pushes me to dark thoughts of ending it all. These feelings of worthlessness and self-pity gnaw at me deeply. It's frustrating to express these sentiments here as the responses often feel insincere and unhelpful. The root cause of my perpetual solitude and lack of intimate experiences stems from my severe chronic depression that suffocates my essence, not because I'm inexperienced – it's something that seems woven into my family history. This condition leaves me emotionally void, dull, and withdrawn, overshadowing any attempts to enhance my personality or social presence as suggested by well-meaning but misguided advice givers. Confidence is a foreign concept when depression lurks within. The monotony of life, the burdensome job routine followed by evenings drenched in despair render any physical improvements insignificant. Life feels like an endless prison sentence with no reprieve in sight.\n\n2. Every fiber of my being rejects engagement with life; the persistent desire to fade away persists relentlessly. The notion that life is akin to a prison holds firm in my mind – there's no joy or fulfillment, just the grind of senseless daily labor. Some may come home to the solace of a loving partner, but that reality remains beyond my grasp indefinitely. Video games offer a shallow escape that fails to captivate anymore; suggestions to explore new avenues fall flat on my weary soul – the struggle lies within, draining me completely till there's nothing left for anything else.\n\n3. Energy eludes me at every turn; efforts seem futile with no fruitful outcomes in sight. Academic pursuits yield disappointment despite long hours invested; physical endeavors at the gym yield marginal gains at best compared to others despite diligence in adherence to proper routines – all overshadowed by an internal emptiness that stifles all progress or joy in interactions with others. Exhaustion pervades every facet of existence; painted as lazy by oblivious parents unaware of the mental turmoil beneath the surface adds salt to already raw wounds – contemplating drastic actions becomes an attractive yet terrifying possibility amidst a sea of hollow advice from those who fail to grasp the depth of despair.\n\n4.. The suffocating grip of depression renders life utterly meaningless - only fleeting solace found in video games while everything else fades into indifference rapidly leaves little hope on the horizon. The notion that venturing into new experiences would somehow lift this heavy haze feels misguided - as depression taints every aspect of life regardless.\n\n5.. Depression casts a shadow so dark it eclipses any semblance of enjoyment from life itself - only finding partial solace in fleeting moments playing video games. Frustration mounts when met with suggestions to branch out and try new things as if a change in activity could lift this oppressive weight crushing down persistently imposed by internal struggles independent from external stimuli dealt with every day relentlessly.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}
{"prompt":"A brief lengthy narrative. Greetings everyone. Battling with depression has been a lifelong struggle for me, starting way back in 2nd grade and only growing more intense over time. I am currently 19, and truth be told, everything in my life seems to be falling apart. I lost both my mother and father (Mom almost 4 years ago, and Dad nearly 5), experiencing mental and physical abuse from my mother – yet strangely harboring no ill feelings towards her. Despite acknowledging that her actions were unacceptable, I understand she was grappling with numerous mental health issues. My father was estranged from me since I was around 11-12; my mom succumbed to sleep apnea and an enlarged heart, while my dad passed away in a car accident. They were estranged from each other, but I deeply miss them both.\n\nThe first time I attempted suicide, I used a phone charger because I couldn't find rope, consumed by despair. After that incident, I made a \"promise\" to myself that I would enlist in the military and perish in combat – yet all of this changed after moving in with my aunt and uncle. Things began looking up: performing well academically, developing friendships, although self-loathing still lingered within me. People around me praised my strength and assured me of their unwavering support irrespective of the circumstances. However, it dawned on me that all my achievements stemmed from depending on the love and assistance of others.\n\nHigh school graduation and college admission only occurred due to their relentless encouragement; however, once college began, everything spiraled downward at a dizzying pace. My academic performance plummeted dramatically alongside the loss of motivation. It's very likely that I may lose my job soon too. Despite several suicide attempts in the past, the thought of causing anguish to my family always dissuaded me.\n\nEach day seems more arduous than the last; recently getting arrested for possessing shrooms (a felony where I reside) led to spending two nights incarcerated – now the sole lifeline appears to be improving my grades which seems implausible given the backlog of missed classes and assignments.\n\nI seldom open up about my emotions and consistently mask my true feelings whenever someone inquires about my well-being. The constant pretense is mentally draining; at times death feels like the only resolution to unite my family considering how much trouble I seem to have caused driving everyone away.\n\nLeaving for campus living has apparently begun mending relations within my aunt's household since I departed; meanwhile, thoughts about orchestrating an accident as a means to end existence have started dominating my mind lately as conventional help lines hold little appeal due to phone-related anxiety issues.\n\nRather than confide in a stranger over the phone due to anxiety concerns, pouring out these thoughts online provides some solace for which I am grateful you've taken time to read this glimpse into what feels like a TED talk session gone awry – apologies for any grammatical or punctuation flaws or any other oversights on my part.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}

{"prompt":"I have sought therapy on and off, but it hasn't provided any relief. Trying out different therapists didn't change much because ultimately, no random individual's words can reverse the time or erase the mistakes I've made in my life. During sessions, the therapist consistently reiterates, \"Your struggles sound challenging, but if you ever feel like ending your life, promise me you'll go to the hospital first.\" It's frustrating; I vehemently disagree.\n\nHowever, one has to comply; otherwise, they might involve law enforcement or admit you to a psychiatric ward, which would undoubtedly worsen the situation. It seems like they are more concerned about not having a suicide occur under their watch than truly caring. Their approach feels like shifting the burden elsewhere as part of their training protocol. If there are those among you who have resolved to go through with it soon, how did you break through that mental barrier that keeps you hanging on?\n\nI have harbored suicidal thoughts for years now, but when faced with practical means like a rod in my closet or a blade against my skin, I falter. Despite longing for an end, I find myself unable to act. The idea of simply slicing my wrist seems straightforward, yet executing it eludes me. I wish desperately for just one sliver of hope from anyone listening – but deep down, I know I lack the strength to follow through.\n\nWhy do you keep subjecting me to this repetitive cycle of agony when you're aware that I lack the resolve? Why do you prolong my suffering without providing an escape? I cannot comprehend why I endure this torment repeatedly. I apologize for whatever transgression led me to deserve this; I'm sorry beyond words. What more can I do? It's all so confusing and unbearable.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

Eating has now become a source of worry for me, as I fear it might worsen the condition of my teeth. When I approached my dentist, the only solution offered was to provide me with a night guard. The realization that my teeth have deteriorated to such an extent fills me with shame. This situation largely arose from neglecting proper oral hygiene due to my struggles with depression, which led me to this point.

It seems like I have been struggling with depression for a significant part of my life without confiding in anyone because I dislike burdening others. The diabetes diagnosis has introduced me to insulin pens, but managing them has proven quite overwhelming. The doctor mentioned the option of switching to a pump if my condition worsens rapidly, providing me with a more convenient way of administering insulin at the push of a button.

I'm giving myself a strict deadline of three weeks to see if things improve, but it's hard to stay positive when faced with the added burden of menstruation. The constant arguments and sounds of suffering around me, whether from the cries of abused animals or the chaos of daily life, have left me drained. I feel like I'm living in a distorted reality where nothing feels genuine anymore – it's always been this way. I'm struggling to find a way to cope or make things right, for others or for myself. These intrusive thoughts of causing harm and seeking pain are deeply troubling. I find myself strangely drawn to experiences like sexual assault and severe illnesses, not out of a desire for attention but as a twisted means to validate my own suffering. I question whether these events actually occurred in my past and why I can't recall them clearly. The pervasive sense of emptiness and detachment has left me feeling lost and disconnected from reality. Despite knowing deep down that I don't have these illnesses or traumas, my mind compulsively fixates on them, worsening my mental state. It's a vicious cycle that reinforces my self-loathing and perpetuates my feelings of worthlessness. As each brief moment of respite is overshadowed by returning despair, I feel like I'm just prolonging the inevitable – the day when everything becomes too much to bear. It's a strange analogy, comparing myself to a sick dog waiting to be euthanized, evoking more empathy for an animal in pain than for myself as a human being. The skewed values society places on different forms of suffering only add to this internal turmoil, leaving me grappling with questions about my own morality and existence.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" in"}

Approaching 30, grappling with persistent depression and anxiety, lacking enthusiasm for work, detesting the career path influenced by my family, regretting past decisions, devoid of real romantic connections and significant friendships, and lacking ambition or objectives. I have a unique eye issue that complicates my vision, a matter my family struggles to comprehend. This condition hinders my ability to drive. Undoubtedly, signs of ADHD have likely been present since childhood, though my family dismisses mental health issues as fictitious, branding them as excuses for laziness and immaturity. My brother believes I lack guilt or shame for what he deems as laziness. Ironically, my mind incessantly bombards me with feelings of guilt and shame, serving as a relentless reminder of my despair. I loathe myself for past actions, current circumstances, and every move I make because I perceive myself as a failure unworthy of affection. Even my so-called \"best friend\" distanced herself upon sensing my despondency, unable to tolerate gloomy energy. I've explored drastic measures like drowning, hanging, and contemplating jumping from the fourth floor of my residence, yet each time fear overtook me before any action could be taken—highlighting the cowardice within me. Self-perception has plummeted to view myself as utterly worthless. Why persist in consuming resources that could benefit others when I am deemed an irredeemable waste?

It is disheartening to feel like a burden on those around me due to something that I struggle to control. The fact that my sole source of relief comes from numbing myself is disheartening. It is emotionally draining to endure my mother's abusive behavior, where she often shifts blame onto me for her own troubles or even scolds me for having panic attacks.

{"prompt":"What happened to me is still a mystery. This all unfolded about 7 months back when I was 17 years old. During a visit to a friend's lake house in April, I took a swing on a tire that was just about 2 feet above the ground. I fell hard on my back, but initially, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. However, that night I started feeling unwell and fatigued, though none of the major symptoms yet surfaced. After returning home two days later, I felt slightly off with a foggy and fuzzy sensation in my head. Around a week passed before I consulted my regular doctor who promptly diagnosed it as a concussion. Despite my symptoms remaining consistent, a neurologist later tagged it as post-concussion syndrome. The peculiar thing was that I never experienced the typical concussion symptoms; only the persistent fogginess.\n\nAs my condition persisted, seeking resolution led me to a chiropractor with no fruitful outcomes. As summer drew to an end, attempted relaxation through golfing proved unsuccessful as things took a turn for the worse; my head no longer felt foggy but rather like it was filled with hot water, causing extreme discomfort. Consequently, I turned to a naturopathic doctor specializing in natural medicine who believed he could alleviate all my symptoms. In addition to undergoing MRI scans, x-rays, and CT scans on various parts of my body, including the back and neck; I sought treatment at a concussion clinic which proved ineffective prompting me to discontinue attendance.\n\nUpon my mother's suggestion, trying CBD oil worsened matters as it heightened inflammation within my head significantly. Subsequently, engaging another naturopathic doctor led to recommendations for visits to vision specialists which returned no alarming findings except for an elevated cortisol level correlating with high stress levels akin to being chased by something intense.\n\nEmbarking on Cymbalta prescribed by this practitioner yielded no improvement despite varying dosages from 30mg to 60mg then reverting back to 30mg.

It's a sense of patheticness that truly engulfs me. Sharing these feelings here is not something I enjoy because all I seem to receive is cliché advice. The root cause behind my perpetual state of virginity and solitude stems from my severe chronic depression, which extinguishes my essence (it's not due to my virginity but rather a trait inherited in my family). It renders me emotionally numb, listless, and withdrawn. Moreover, I don't possess exceptional attractiveness either. When individuals say \"enhance your personality or be more socially active,\" they fail to grasp the impact of depression on making me an unappealing individual. It's not always at the forefront of my mind, but when it hits hard, it drives me towards thoughts of ending it all. I detest life - its routines from an unfulfilling job to returning home consumed by despair. Even maintaining good physical fitness brings no change to this existential agony, making it impossible to exude confidence under the weight of depression. My loathing for life grows as I wait for more insincere advice after sharing this outpouring.\n\n- Life feels like a relentless sentence; there are no ambitions within me anymore.

Video games serve as mere distractions rather than sources of genuine enjoyment. Suggestions about exploring new activities only add to the irritation as my internal struggles far outweigh any external stimulations. A perpetual lack of energy plagues every aspect of life; every endeavor feels futile and draining due to perceived low intelligence and worthlessness that poison my outlook on existence. Despite years spent sweating at the gym, physical gains are sluggish compared to others who seem to excel effortlessly; similarly, social interactions remain an insurmountable challenge as an indescribable emptiness hampers any meaningful connection with others.\n\n- The burdening weight of depression is surreal; discussing its implications remains tabooed territory for many people..

The distant bridge stands 24 miles away, tempting yet daunting as I battle the ache in my mind. Despite the prospect of marriage from my boyfriend looming ahead, I grapple with not having suitable attire or a job lined up - leaving me feeling idle and apprehensive as I pass the hours by barely engaged in conversation.\n\nFutilely scouring job listings adds to my sense of despair; lacking references, work attire, experience or presentation skills makes the job hunt seem futile and leaves me feeling invisible and undesired.\n\nMy struggles are not merely psychological but borne out of dire circumstances. Others around me believe that seeking help will magically solve everything but fail to grasp the weight of being without work or purpose while everyone else is gainfully employed or retired - brewing resentment within me towards them all.\n\nDetermined that tomorrow must mark the end - no job prospects, no social life, no wardrobe suitable for public appearances or engaging conversations - it all seems like a downward spiral tilting towards an inevitable conclusion.\n\nAt 40 years old and utterly lost - prospects for employment seem dim; struggling to fill each passing moment with meaning amidst dwindling financial support from family. With sparse attire choices and scant verbal expressions daily while living alongside a chatterbox partner leaves me grappling with suicidal thoughts on repeat each day relentlessly.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

{"prompt":"Hello everyone,. I've been grappling with depression for an extended period, dating back to my experiences in 2nd grade, and the struggle has only intensified since then. I'm currently 19 years old, and things in my life are spiraling out of control. Both my mother and father have passed away (mom nearly 4 years ago, dad almost 5), and I endured mental and physical abuse from my mother, although strangely I harbor no animosity towards her. Despite acknowledging that her actions were unacceptable, I understand she was battling numerous mental health issues. My father was absent from my life since I was around 11 or 12; mom's passing was attributed to sleep apnea and an enlarged heart, while dad died in a car accident. They were estranged from each other, and I deeply miss them both. \n\nOn a particular occasion when I felt utterly hopeless, unable to find rope and resorting to using a phone charger, I made an attempt to end my life – it was then that I made a solemn promise to myself that instead of trying again, I would enlist in the military and meet my end in combat. However, this mindset shifted once I moved in with my aunt and uncle. Things seemed to improve: my academic performance was satisfactory, though self-loathing persisted. People around me – friends and family – praised me for my strength, assuring me of their unwavering support no matter what. But deep down, it dawned on me that everything I had achieved was essentially riding on the support and love of others.\n\nSurviving high school and gaining entry into college were feats largely propelled by their relentless encouragement; however, once college commenced, everything unraveled rapidly. My grades plummeted, signifying the end of relying on others for success. My work ethic faltered, leaving me on the verge of losing my job. Multiple suicide attempts have been made but thoughts of the anguish it would inflict upon my family always held me back.\n\nEvery day feels increasingly arduous; recently being arrested for possession of shrooms (a felony where I reside) resulted in two nights spent in jail. To prevent matters from exacerbating further, improving my grades is imperative; a daunting task given all the missed classes and assignments. Opening up about my emotions isn't something I'm comfortable with as I consistently mask how I truly feel when asked if I'm okay.\n\nThe mental strain is becoming unbearable; death appears as a tempting solution to reconcile with family members who perceive me as nothing but trouble – someone who pushed them away instead of bring them closer together. Since moving onto campus dorms after leaving my aunt and uncle's home, there are signs of improvement within their family dynamic which leads me to ponder dark scenarios of making it appear as an inadvertent accident should things come to that point.\n\nI'm hesitant about reaching out to hotline services due to phone-related anxiety; hence why sharing this online feels more appropriate for me at this time..

{"prompt":"I'm struggling to contain everything inside, and it feels like I'm reaching a breaking point. The weight of it all is pushing me towards thoughts of ending my life. Despite this overwhelming urge to confide in someone, I find myself incapable of doing so. Whenever I attempt to open up, I only manage to share bits and pieces before withdrawing completely or pretending that I'm fine now. It's peculiar how there's only one person I feel safe enough to talk to, even though I can't fathom confiding in anyone else, not even my own mother. Strangely enough, this individual happens to be someone indirectly connected to me through her daughter who is quite popular and also teaches at my school. Although we've known each other for years, our acquaintance remains superficial. Despite having longtime acquaintances among the teaching staff, approaching them for help seems equally daunting. Engaging with an unfamiliar person poses its own challenges as well; somehow, I always find myself downplaying my struggles and claiming that everything is resolved when in reality it's far from it. I once attempted to open up to a teacher over a span of four months but eventually felt ashamed of burdening her with my issues when she had her own responsibilities to tend to. Subsequently, I apologized for my persistence and vowed not to trouble her again - a promise which led me into silence once more. Seeking assistance from others has consistently resulted in me reassuring them that everything is fine before ceasing all communication abruptly. The truth is that things are far from okay; the realization that suicide is inevitable has begun sinking in. While unsure of the exact timing, the certainty of this decision looms incessantly in my mind. The self-harming persists as a coping mechanism while the thought of leaving behind my loyal dog delays any immediate action on these suicidal impulses. Despite appearing composed on the outside for an extended period, inside, I'm far from alright. Feeling utterly lost with no clear path ahead, the notion of bottling everything up until reaching a breaking point and opting for suicide seems increasingly likely.

I currently reside with my parents, both of whom are smokers, and unfortunately, it is nearly impossible to escape the secondhand smoke they produce. They often sit on the step that links the kitchen to the garden while smoking, allowing the smoke to seep into our home. Moreover, they frequently light their cigarettes indoors before putting their heads inside their car to smoke further. When I attempt to address this issue with them, my dad becomes defensive and dismisses my concerns as unreasonable. The idea of inhaling all that smoke weighs heavily on me; I fear for the health of my lungs and worry that lung cancer may be inevitable.

Confronting my parents about the help I desperately need feels like an insurmountable task. Despite receiving a diagnosis of moderate depression and anxiety, quitting alcohol has not alleviated my deepening despair; each day seems more arduous than the last, with thoughts of death pervading my mind. Bereft of friendships, my sole prospect lies in seeking therapy and medication, but disclosing this financial burden to my parents remains daunting, particularly due to our communication barriers. The cycle of self-sabotage is inescapable; although I strive for betterment, repeated failures fuel my resignation to a solitary fate that death promises to fulfill.

My mental well-being throughout this school year has been extremely poor. With the exception of occasional conversations with my parents and one other person, I have isolated myself. There have been numerous assignments that I have neglected to complete; it's almost miraculous that I have managed to maintain a C- in my most challenging classes. Now, as I confront all the unfinished tasks and realize that I am unable to submit them according to the syllabus guidelines I overlooked – which stated no late work would be accepted after our last test – a sense of hopelessness takes over. And let's not even delve into the looming AP Biology exam scheduled for Thursday. I haven't been attentive at all during the past semester, relying solely on Quizlet for every test to maintain my current grade. I am at the end of my rope. I understand it's merely a two-week stretch remaining before it's all over, but coping has become increasingly arduous. The weight of recent events, including my experience studying and crying myself to sleep in preparation for my previous AP exam last Thursday, has become unbearable. It distresses me deeply that suicide is now a contemplation when it never crossed my mind throughout this entire tumultuous year and beyond. Were it not for my parents, who undoubtedly expect greatness from me although they never explicitly say so, I wouldn't care at all. They are aware of my intelligence, as am I, yet they remain oblivious to the turmoil plaguing my mind. As time goes by, my parents seem to be discussing future plans more frequently – which college to attend, what major to pursue, career aspirations – questions for which I simply do not have answers. This is something I have wanted to express for quite some time: I am lost and confused about these heavy topics that were never on my radar before now as a 15-year-old trying desperately to find joy each day since the onset of quarantine. My once reliable coping mechanisms no longer provide solace; even activities that used to bring me happiness now feel hollow and ineffectual.

Admitting that I frequently skip appointments with my psychologist and school counselors to avoid these costs is something I must acknowledge. These thoughts of ending my life have become a familiar presence over time, almost turning into a disturbing preoccupation. During my idle moments, I've pondered and planned nearly every conceivable method of carrying out this act within the confines of my home quarantine situation. Whether it's calculating the lethal dose of isopropyl alcohol for ingesting or testing various spots for anchoring a noose, I've explored these grim possibilities extensively. There were moments when jumping in front of a neighbor's speeding car seemed like an option, but the fear of causing them trauma pushed me away from it. Even ensuring that my family wouldn't interrupt if I decided to go through with it has crossed my mind. This dark pastime has taken hold for too long now.\n\nMy motivation for wanting to end my life is rooted in self-loathing; a straightforward yet all-encompassing feeling.

Words like 'idiot,' 'disappointment,' 'coward,' 'sloth,' 'burden,' 'failure,' 'damaged goods,' 'hypocrite,' 'emotionally constipated,' 'man-child,' and 'degenerate' echo in my mind when vulnerability strikes - a state that sadly seems constant currently.\n\nDespite hearing reassurances that this phase will pass from friends and family, their efforts have only deepened my sense of guilt for troubling them unnecessarily; I feel undeserving of their concern. Professional help has been sought but financial constraints have limited consistent visits, while medications seem less effective now with stronger alternatives being financially out of reach as well.\n\nPreviously reliable coping mechanisms have faltered, especially following the loss of my mother earlier this year - an event that has left me consumed by anxiety and self-disdain ever since. The thought of making her proud was what kept me going, and now that she's no longer here, guilt exacerbates the pain further.\n\nAmidst this turmoil, suicide feels like an ever-present option with detailed plans waiting to be carried out; however, I can't bring myself to follow through because deep down, I don't believe I deserve such an easy exit given the hurt I've caused others.

It may not be a sufficient reason to keep living but right now it's what keeps me going.\n\nIn writing this post without clear expectations or objectives beyond relating to others experiencing similar struggles with suicidal thoughts while marveling at their complexity, maybe just adding to the discussion was all I wanted. doubt lingers about seeking advice or expressing accurately how deeply entrenched these struggles are within me amidst growing skepticism towards outside guidance during these trying times.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

{"prompt":"My situation is worsening, and the thought of ending my life lingers constantly, though taking that step seems out of reach for me. Each passing day presents new challenges that seem more insurmountable than before. The lingering effects of emotional neglect from my parents continue to haunt me, and the yearning for the affection and attention I was deprived of remains my sole reason for persevering. This pursuit dictates every aspect of my existence. It typically begins with observing someone being lauded for their accomplishments, triggering a conviction within me that I must replicate those achievements to earn love. Even the simplest things like viewing a drawing intensify my despair. Seeking professional help is not an option as my mother's disapproval towards even a hint of sadness leaves me petrified. Broaching any topic related to mental well-being fills me with dread of facing her wrath once again. Insignificant and undeserving are words that define my self-perception. I convince myself that others face far greater struggles than mine and thus merit the care I lack. Hearing about others' hardships only plunges me deeper into sadness and envy, as they receive the love I crave but will never experience. It seems like there's no escape from this torment except to bring it all to an end. However, my inability to inflict harm upon myself persists, leaving me trapped in this cycle. The reasons elude me, but the reality remains—I simply cannot do it.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}
{"prompt":"Feeling like a coward. I've been contemplating how to end it all. Somehow, every time I've made an attempt, when push comes to shove, I back out at the last moment. I thought I had moved past these suicidal thoughts, but here I am feeling completely cornered. My life has been filled with so much pain, and there's this one incredibly twisted and brutal experience that feels like it defines my entire existence - it's too heavy for anyone to bear hearing about. Besides my two friends of ten years who have been there for me – one even intervened during my first attempt by calling 911 – there's also my mom. Then there's someone I deeply care for, though it's become evident they probably no longer want me in their life. The regret of messing up a good thing with this person weighs heavier on me than all the past pain combined. I have no interest in finding someone new; my heart is weary and fragile beyond repair after this individual. And though I was making progress, my current living situation coupled with ongoing trauma and lack of closure is pushing me back into this dark place where those who hurt me seem to be getting their happily ever afters while I'm left grappling with thoughts of leaping in front of a train. It's not that I want to hurt the few people who care about me or even the person I love; but deep down, it seems like no one would truly be affected by my departure, perhaps even finding solace in it. All I want is to find the courage not to flinch and retreat when the moment arrives; how can I stop being a coward and face it head-on? It’s not something I truly desire deep down, but all that seems left for me now. How can I resist the urge to step off the tracks when the train approaches? Living so near them has made me familiar with the train schedules, yet every time my heart races, and tears well up as panic grips me when faced with that choice.

{"prompt":"I'm a 21-year-old male and it feels like love is something I'll never get to experience. I struggle with mental and emotional instability, feeling unlovable due to my perceived oddness and unattractiveness. All I crave is a loving relationship with a woman to share my life with, but I can't shake off this overwhelming sense of inadequacy that leaves me convinced that I'm destined for a life of solitude. Admitting to my parents that I need help seems like an insurmountable task. I've been diagnosed with moderate depression and anxiety, which led me to quit drinking in hopes of improvement. Unfortunately, my mental state has only deteriorated, making it almost impossible to even get out of bed as thoughts of death consume me. With no friends left, seeking therapy along with medication appears to be my only beacon of hope. However, expressing this need for therapy to my parents proves to be challenging, especially considering our lack of open communication. The cycle of self-sabotage seems never-ending at 21; despite my efforts at self-improvement, constant failure reinforces the belief that I am destined for a solitary existence – a prospect that death strangely provides some solace from. As much as I long for an end, the fear within prevents me from taking matters into my own hands; hence, hoping for an end rather than actively seeking it out seems like the path ahead. Tonight holds the allure of being the perfect occasion to put an end to this suffering. The weight of Valentine's Day bears down on me every year as a stark reminder of my perennial loneliness; devoid of even a semblance of romantic companionship in the past and harboring grim premonitions about the future unfolding similarly bleakly. A fallout with friends today underscores how toxic I must be perceived as, driving me towards numbing the ache with alcohol and contemplating drastic measures thereafter. To all those whom I have let down, know that my absence may well be a relief for everyone involved. My tendency to oversexualize women looms over me like an ominous cloud at 21 – having never successfully navigated a romantic relationship and facing dim prospects ahead due to this issue that fills me with dread and difficulty in managing interactions with women appropriately. Another Valentine's Day spent alone beckons bleakness; drowning sorrows in alcohol tonight may very well be an attempt at temporary respite from this desolation. This day filled with displays of affection only serves as a bitter reminder of how inadequate and isolated I feel compared to those around me who seem content in their relationships while I exist on the fringes yearning for an escape from this perpetual solitude.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

How do they genuinely assign value to their own continued existence? Consider this: the average human lifespan spans roughly around 80 years. I'm only 21, which means I still have approximately 60 years left. Let's assume that true living really begins at around age 5 or 6 (since early childhood is mostly devoid of forming substantial memories and a complete understanding of time). So essentially, out of my total years alive, I've only truly experienced about 15 years, and they weren't particularly great.

We find ourselves toiling away longer hours for diminishing returns, all to feed the insatiable greed of billionaires. Back in the 50s-70s, even a factory worker had a better quality of life compared to what young professionals experience today. As a man, it's tough for me to navigate the realm of relationships and love. I face scrutiny for simply having standards and seeking a fair partnership - it has nothing to do with superficial qualities like looks; I'm not asking for some idealized princess. While women can choose and evaluate offers, men are expected to shoulder all the burden (how's that for equality, right? \/s). Throughout my life, I've endured bullying, harassment, and mistreatment. My parents refuse to accept me as I am because I don't adhere to the strict religious beliefs they raised me with, and without a supportive partner, I feel trapped with no way out. There are additional challenges stemming from navigating the expectations of being part of South Asian Muslim culture (even in Western societies).\n\nEvery time I express my struggles or discontent, I'm met with criticism and victim-blaming.

While staying with them is not something I prefer, it seemed like the only option compared to contemplating taking my own life. The mere thought of what they now know makes me physically sick. At a point where suicide seemed imminent, I reached out in a moment of despair through a text to my mother, leading to the current situation of leaving college and preparing for the move back home.

I make an effort to check in with him regularly, ensuring his well-being and trying to prevent any harmful decisions. Uncertain if others are providing support, I assume I am one of the few outside of his therapist who is there for him.\n\nThe dilemma lies in my own struggles with suicidal thoughts, a truth I have never shared with anyone, including him. It becomes increasingly challenging for me to conceal this fact from him as we converse. Initially, as I encouraged him to persevere, my conviction wavered as it felt hypocritical coming from someone battling similar dark thoughts. Even now, as I strive to stand by him as a friend, I question the morality of advocating for life when my own desire to continue living falters.\n\nI grapple with the decision of whether honesty or silence is the better approach - whether revealing my struggles could offer authenticity but potentially harm his own well-being or if maintaining a facade is more beneficial for him at this time.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

Ghosting offers little insight into situations, often leaving me feeling paranoid and unable to comprehend the underlying reasons. While some pursue casual encounters, my search for genuine human connection leaves me feeling even more desolate. Much of my past intimacy stemmed from a desire for security rather than mere physical pleasure. This is not a cry for attention or salvation but a solemn acknowledgment. Responses on platforms like this subreddit often simplify complex issues by urging against self-harm without providing tangible solutions, fostering false hope in nonexistent rescue. Reassurances that circumstances are fleeting or will improve ring hollow when reality proves otherwise, leading to a growing sense of hopelessness.

A few days ago, while I was at the gas station checkout, an older, slightly overweight man stood way too close behind me in line, to the point where his privates were making contact with my back.

Even when the store employee intervened and asked him to give me space, he still refused to step back, though there was ample room for him to do so. Instances like this occur because of my slender build which gives off the impression that I won't assert myself.

The exhaustion from repeatedly bargaining with myself for more time is overwhelming. I'm weary of the relentless battle to mend myself when the sole motivation behind it is to make it less difficult for me to endure existence and shield my loved ones from pain. However, truth be told, there are occasions when their welfare doesn't hold the same weight anymore. Perhaps it's deemed as callous. Perhaps it aligns with that 'apathy towards others' concept discussed during my PTSD diagnosis (which still bewilders me; feels like my struggles never reached a severe level in my eyes. Little did I know not everyone dwells in an enduring sense of fear, agony, and detachment). The indifference is all-consuming.

Why do I continue living while they found peace in death?\" The unsettling question lingers, \"Is ending your own life really that difficult?\" with the inevitable answer always being no. These thoughts are leading me down a dark path and I acknowledge the need to change. My approach won't involve suddenly adopting healthy habits or actively seeking happiness; instead, I will strive to be more mindful and considerate in the future. Despite this determination, feelings of hopelessness still persist within me.\". My pain often goes unnoticed by\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

There's a persistent contemplation of suicide, yet every time I've mustered the courage to act, my instincts take over last minute, prompting me to retreat. Despite believing I had overcome these dark thoughts, the weight on my shoulders is suffocating. The depth of my suffering is beyond words, with just a fragment of it enough to shatter any listener. Apart from two lifelong friends and my concerned mother, I feel utterly alone. While one friend's quick response saved me during a previous attempt, the individual I hold dear now seems out of reach, intensifying my anguish. The thought of starting anew with someone else feels impossible as my heart remains wounded and exhausted. My struggles were manageable until recent changes in my living situation emerged, rekindling past traumas without any closure or justice. Witnessing those who caused my pain thrive while I suffer ignites a desire to end it all by any means possible. Though I dread hurting those few who care for me or the one I love profoundly, doubt lingers whether anyone would truly miss me if I were gone – perhaps even finding relief in my absence. Desperately seeking guidance on how to confront these feelings head-on instead of evading them at the last moment; fighting this internal battle despite feeling like there's nothing left but despair. Familiar with the train schedules due to living near the tracks, yet paralyzed by fear when faced with the reality of carrying out such drastic actions.

{"prompt":"I am giving myself a deadline of 3 weeks before considering taking drastic measures. Dealing with the added stress of experiencing menstrual cycles only adds to the burden. The constant arguments and sounds of distress from abused animals in the household weigh heavily on me. Feeling disconnected and like nothing around me is genuine is not a new sensation. I am struggling to find a way to cope or repair the situation, whether it be with others or myself. The intrusive thoughts of violence and self-harm trouble me deeply, as does the inexplicable desire for tragic events to unfold. These inclinations toward suffering or assault are not normal longings, begging the question of their origin and plausibility. Perhaps buried memories contribute to these disturbing fantasies, despite my inability to recollect any specific trauma. It's not about seeking attention but rather seeking validation through extreme means, which only exacerbates feelings of inadequacy. A sense of unworthiness pervades my thoughts, believing that my struggles are not severe enough to warrant attention or support. The temptation to adopt illnesses or disabilities that I do not actually have reflects a deeper struggle within me, perpetuating this cycle of despair and self-neglect. This internal conflict leads me to question what has led me here and why I am plagued by such destructive tendencies. The self-destructive behavior mirrors how I perceive myself - as something broken and beyond repair, patiently awaiting an inevitable decline. It's disheartening to witness this mental deterioration compared to how we empathize more readily with suffering animals than with fellow humans in similar distressing situations.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" in"}

It's been an eternity since I've experienced that kind of emotion. Today marks the anniversary of a missed opportunity, and it has left me feeling utterly devastated and hollow inside. For a few days in a row, I managed to feel somewhat okay, and it almost felt surreal how okay I was starting to feel. But now it seems like I'm right back at square one. It's becoming increasingly difficult; these fleeting moments of hope for genuine happiness are unbearable. My thoughts of suicide are intensifying by the day.

Currently, I am on a work placement that will conclude in six months, leaving me uncertain about my future. I feel inadequate because I lack the necessary skills and find it frustrating how references and constantly giving your best are essential in securing jobs. Despite my repeated efforts, excelling at interviews remains a challenge. The continuous cycle of never feeling good enough for job roles is becoming unbearable, especially considering the financial pressures and the complexities of housing in the UK.\n\nIt's easy for me to get emotional, struggling to assert myself when faced with unfair treatment—which seems to be a recurring theme for me. The daily routine of preparing for work feels like a burden as I navigate this competitive environment that resembles a rat race. At times, the idea of suicide seems like the only escape route from this overwhelming situation, despite having other underlying issues that worry me. Money concerns weigh heavily on my mind as I doubt my intelligence and face obstacles when seeking professional references.\n\nMy lack of initiative along with poor memory recall make it hard for me to engage in activities that might pique my interest. Attempting to communicate in a professional manner proves challenging despite investing time watching informative videos and trying to learn from observation. My responses during formal interactions are often marred by awkward pauses, causing considerable embarrassment each time.\n\nA sense of emptiness envelops me as mounting pressures at 22 years old seem insurmountable. Although thoughts of self-harm have crossed my mind, I haven't been able to follow through with those impulses. Posting on platforms like this serves as an outlet to share my bleak perceptions about this world we live in, one that was reinforced by an unpleasant interaction with a coworker recently.\n\nEstablishing meaningful connections with others has always been difficult for me; devoid of friends or any real desire to forge new friendships, yet recognizing its potential impact on my well-being troubles me deeply.

The way people treat me - with condescension and cruelty, making me feel inferior and obligated to cater to their needs as though interacting with me is a charitable act - is soul-crushing. The constant criticism of my imperfections, even though they have no bearing on others either directly or indirectly, weighs heavily on me. The accumulation of these interactions has pushed me to a point where I am consumed by anger and dark thoughts. The realization that I was treated in such a dehumanizing manner while growing up has been a harsh awakening.\n\nWhile wearing a mask, my appearance seems to undergo a transformation - my eyes are admired for their beauty and my nose bridge is deemed attractive, yet the lower half of my face remains an area of contention. In these moments, people display kindness, sympathy, and acceptance towards me without having to see the unmasked part of my face. This stark contrast in treatment has left me feeling lost and unsure of how to navigate this issue, particularly as I lack the financial means for any kind of cosmetic surgery.\n\nThe trajectory of my life thus far has been marred by abuse - from a toxic family environment to enduring bullying throughout my schooling years.

The idea of assisted suicide being an option for those in a terminally desolate state like mine seems like a distant wish. Each night as I navigate through risky areas, a part of me silently hopes that someone will relieve me of this painful existence, but alas, it remains just wishful thinking. Every day feels like a relentless cycle of self-sabotage and diminishing hope, as I grapple with the overwhelming weight of my mistakes that have led me down this path. Life seems like an unending uphill battle, unmerciful in its continuity and increasingly challenging to endure. Brief moments of emotional numbness bring some respite, but they are fleeting, and soon give way to sporadic tears that accompany me through each passing day, followed by tearful nights.\n\nIf only there was a way to rewind time and undo the choices that set off this downward spiral; however, such fantasies are futile. The thought weighs heavily on me—my inability to end the suffering due to my own cowardice prolongs this agonizing journey. The constant reminder of my perceived inadequacy and isolation gnaws at me relentlessly, fostering a sense of worthlessness that permeates through every aspect of my being.\n\nIn fleeting dreams induced by substances, I glimpse an alternate reality where life is more vibrant and engaging—a stark contrast to the bleakness that surrounds me when I am awake. These illusions only serve to intensify my desire for release from this unending torment.

My mental and emotional instability, coupled with my feelings of inadequacy and unattractiveness, make me convinced that I am unlovable. All I crave is the companionship of a woman to share my life with, but my own self-perception as a failure leads me to believe that solitude is my destined path. It's challenging for me to discuss these deep-seated issues with my parents, despite being diagnosed with moderate depression and anxiety. Although I made the decision to stop drinking in an effort to alleviate some of my struggles, it seems that my mental health continues to deteriorate, leaving me bedridden with thoughts of death lingering in my mind.\n\nHaving distanced myself from all my friends, seeking therapy and medication appears to be my only beacon of hope. However, the financial aspect adds another layer of difficulty as I must confront my parents about the necessity for therapy, something I typically keep concealed due to our strained communication. The pattern of self-sabotage in my life seems unbreakable at 21; every attempt at betterment ends in failure, reinforcing the notion that a solitary demise awaits me. Despite contemplating suicide as a way out of this torment, fear prevents me from carrying out such drastic actions; instead, I resign myself to the notion that perhaps dying naturally is preferable since living feels unbearable.\n\nTonight feels like an opportune moment to bring about an end to this inner turmoil. At 21 years old, Valentine's Day serves as a brutal reminder of my perpetual loneliness – devoid of any semblance of romantic connection. The recent fallout with my friends further plunges me into this abyss of self-loathing, prompting thoughts of drowning these sorrows in alcohol followed by darker impulses towards self-harm. To those whom I've let down along the way, I offer my sincerest apologies but believe that the world would be improved by my absence.\n\nMy tendency to excessively sexualize women has become a significant barrier in forming genuine relationships at 21; this fixation not only permeates real-life interactions but extends into media consumption where objectification seems involuntary yet alarming even to myself. The shame and fear stemming from these behaviors exacerbate social anxieties and further isolate me on yet another Valentine's Day. The day ahead beckons excessive drinking as a coping mechanism topped with silent prayers not for tomorrow’s awakening.\n\nValentine’s Day has transformed into an annual torment for me at 21 – magnifying feelings of inadequacy and alienation as everyone around me celebrates love while I remain ensnared by perpetual solitude. A pervasive sense of worthlessness looms large over me as each passing year reinforces the idea that perhaps it’s time for this torment to cease once and for all.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

It's frustrating that I can't seek solace in discussing this because I anticipate being criticized by those who subscribe to the idea of victim blaming. Despite putting in considerable effort and doing all the right things, my circumstances remain unfavorable due to factors beyond my control. For many, life seems nothing but a relentless burden while others seem to lead charmed lives. The current scenario where individuals are toiling longer and harder for diminishing returns only serves to cater to the insatiable greed of billionaires. Back in the 1950s-70s, a factory worker enjoyed a higher quality of life than a young professional does today. Being a man, it feels like an uphill battle for me to find love, and I face criticism for seeking a fair partnership based on mutual respect (and this is not about physical appearances – I simply desire fairness, not some idealized version). Women seem to have the luxury of choice and options while men constantly bear the weight of initiating and sustaining relationships (equality seems like a joke sometimes \/s). Throughout my life, I've endured bullying, harassment, and consistent mistreatment. My parents fail to accept me for who I am since I no longer adhere to the strict faith in which I was raised, but without a supportive partner by my side, it feels like there's no escape from this situation. There are additional complex issues within that dynamic as well. Living within South Asian Muslim culture (even within Western society) presents its own set of challenges that further compound my struggles.

While checking out at the cash register, an older, slightly overweight man stood uncomfortably close behind me, to the point where his private parts were making contact with my back. Despite my attempts to shift away, he persistently invaded my personal space. Due to my reserved and socially anxious nature, I didn't speak up. Eventually, a store employee intervened and pointed out the inappropriate proximity, but the man disregarded the warning. This incident isn't isolated; it reflects a pattern where people target me because of my slender build and assumption that I won't assert myself. The accumulation of such degrading situations weighs heavily on me.

{"prompt":"I am currently facing the possibility of losing my job, feeling that my boss holds animosity towards me, and believing that it is justified. At 21 years old, I completed college in December. My upbringing was within a family environment shaped by my eccentric, hyper-evangelical homeschooling parents, which had an unhealthy influence on me. Despite working hard to obtain a degree and leave my Appalachian hometown to pursue a career in software engineering, my initial job misrepresented the role after I was hired and restricted me to a challenging position. I secured another job with the help of my limited networking resources from university, but doubt my ability to secure another opportunity due to a series of early missteps. I unintentionally overlooked an email, delayed HR processes by failing to promptly sign necessary documents, and have just been assigned to a QA team earlier today rather than within software development - out of concern about history repeating itself from my previous job's experience, I hesitantly agreed. My boss explicitly expressed disdain towards me and pinpointed all the errors I've made thus far (which are valid), putting me on thin ice for demonstrating hesitance. This occurred a few hours ago; although I have reached out with an apology and found common ground with my new team members, there remains an unsettling sense of apprehension within me.

I vividly recall the chaos that ensued – the shouting, the physical pain, the disorientation, and ultimately, the hospitalization. Fast forward to when I was 21, when I acquired a firearm for the first time. Despite conducting thorough research on its usage and pinpointing where to aim for a fatal shot to my head, the sheer agony and a minor technical issue prevented me from pulling the trigger successfully. This incident led to intervention and hospitalization due to concerns for my safety.\n\nMore recently, I acquired rope suitable for hanging myself. Convinced that I had mastered the technique of partial suspension hanging and had positioned the noose correctly, I attempted it in seclusion. However, all it resulted in was excruciating pressure around my neck without any loss of consciousness – eventually conceding defeat with a bruised and swollen face from burst blood vessels.\n\nNowadays, I have set up an exit bag method meticulously without experiencing any emotional response during preparation - much like how I have approached various situations in life lately. Over time, my chronic depression has transformed into depersonalization leading me to feel profoundly empty - numb to everything. Yet, when I initiated this method involving gas inhalation by turning on the valve, an unexpected loud hiss triggered overwhelming panic alongside physical discomfort in my chest. Although theoretically painless, this sudden realization brought me to a standstill as doubts crept in.\n\nI am at a loss for how to process these emotions at this juncture. While cognizant that this method guarantees success if executed correctly (which has been my case), confronting the stark reality of no longer having anyone in my life to confide in or leave behind a heartfelt message adds another layer of sorrow.\n\nAcknowledging that this could indeed be my final act aligning with my long-held fears is profoundly disconcerting. The battle against suicidal thoughts has been ongoing - from feeling desperate about wanting to die until reaching a state of emotional detachment from everything. Now that I stand on the brink of it all, emotions vacillate between solitude and apprehension.\n\nI am unsure of what support or guidance I seek by sharing this account but confront simultaneous fears of both failing in my attempt and facing death itself; coupled with deep regret over inadvertently alienating the few remaining individuals in my life through actions or decisions taken during this tumultuous period - fostering profound feelings of isolation and fatigue within me\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}

The idea that they might connect my online activities to my real-life identity is terrifying. The last thing I’d want is for my university to discover my suicide attempt, given their stance on such matters. They tend to see students in distress as a liability, which could tarnish the school’s reputation. The thought of my parents finding out is equally distressing – I wonder if it's even within their rights to disclose such information. The fear of being compelled into treatment is also weighing on me because it's something I can't afford.\n  \n- It's disheartening how cultural influences contribute significantly to the stigma surrounding mental health.\n  \n- I find solace in the notion of being left alone, devoid of anyone’s concern. Paradoxically, it’s this very care and attention that fuels my suicidal thoughts. It would be simpler if nobody paid me any mind. This way, I could depart unnoticed, causing no hurt when I’m gone. Living up to their expectations has become overwhelming; failing repeatedly and being a constant source of disappointment has drained me.

Not being able to enjoy my birthday due to being isolated as punishment has added another layer of despair to an already bleak situation. It's disheartening not having anyone to talk to or anything enjoyable to pass the time with while grappling with suicidal thoughts. It's as if happiness and joy are undeserving elements in my life.\n\nThe feeling that I am unworthy of happiness or joy has been forcefully instilled in me. Every effort seems futile, every glimmer of hope swiftly extinguished by relentless punishment and expectations that are spiraling out of control. The continuous cycle of feeling inadequate and facing repercussions has eroded any semblance of motivation or resilience within me.\n\nDespite reassuring myself that I wouldn't resort to self-harm today, I once again find myself teetering on the edge of despair, contemplating if maybe succumbing to these thoughts would be easier than enduring this never-ending torment. The sheer exhaustion and sense of futility in everything I do weigh heavily on me – invalidating any shred of progress or effort exerted thus far.\n\nThe pervasive sense of being a disappointment lingers over me like a dark cloud, clouding every aspect of my existence. While attempting to alleviate my distress by engaging in activities that bring solace, only led me back into the punitive grasp that dictates nearly every facet of my life currently.\n\nThe perpetual focus on grades over well-being by those around me serves as a harsh reminder that my struggles are overlooked under the guise of academic success being paramount. Instead of addressing the root cause of academic decline or reaching out with empathy and support, punitive measures are employed, exacerbating an already dire situation.\n\nSuch disregard for mental health concerns and dismissing them as trivialities is deeply disheartening – further isolating me in a sea of turmoil without a lifeline in sight.\n\nIt's disheartening how every effort put forth is seemingly met with disdain or indifference towards the underlying struggles that continue to weigh heavily on me - further exacerbating feelings Of inadequacy and hopelessness.\n\nThis perpetual cycle leaves me drained both mentally and emotionally - counting down the days until I reach 18 becomes increasingly enticing as an escape from this relentless anguish plaguing every waking moment.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}

My agitation is constant, and I fear that even the smallest inconvenience might trigger an explosive reaction regardless of the circumstances. There is a genuine concern that my behavior could escalate to the point where I harm someone significantly and end up in prison. The two options before me are to go to the emergency room and confess my suicidal intentions, requesting admission to a psychiatric unit or to follow through with ending my own life. While I am still pondering this decision and have not taken any action yet, I believe it might be best for society if I were to remain institutionalized for the remainder of my days. With no family to speak of, it is unlikely anyone would notice or mourn my absence. As for the financial aspect, it is uncertain how I will manage the costs involved. Perhaps one day, I will meet a tragic end in obscurity like countless nameless individuals who perish on the streets and end up cremated without ceremony.

Although I enjoy spending time with my cousins, I often feel like a misfit and worry that they would be better off without me. It's as if I'm a burden to those around me. At present, my only close friend is someone who used to be my teacher. There have been instances when I've contemplated self-harm, holding a knife to my wrist on three occasions but being unable to go through with it each time. This failure makes me question my own courage and leaves me haunted by visions of how my family would react upon discovering me lifeless in a pool of blood.

{"prompt":"For 4,808 days straight, the thought of ending my life has been a constant companion. I've made several attempts to take my own life, and strangely, I don't feel remorse about them. The closest I came to success was when someone who had previously taken their own life intervened and saved me. It's a twisted mix of emotions - jealousy and anger towards them. The concept of \"my body, my choice\" should logically extend to the right to end one's own life. The current societal stance of prohibiting suicide but then neglecting those struggling is utterly flawed. What's even more disheartening is how this despair seems to spread like a virus, infecting those around me. Despite being on medication, my major depressive disorder seems resistant to treatment. The only fleeting moments of joy I've experienced lately have been while under the influence of substances that momentarily shield me from relentless intrusive thoughts that plague me every waking second.

I cannot help but feel like a terrible person when I reflect on my past mistakes and poor decisions. My emotional instability and anxiety have caused me to ruin nearly all my relationships or any chance of forming new ones.\n\nThe weight of shame from my past actions weighs heavily on me, especially as I witness the repercussions of losing so many friends over the past year. Now that I have graduated from college, maintaining connections has become even more challenging, especially since unemployment leaves me confined to my home, grappling with what direction to take next. The shame and depression that plague me daily due to the issues mentioned earlier have pushed me further into isolation.\n\nI am overwhelmed by feelings of loneliness as if every day is a struggle just to endure. My family, particularly my mom, is worried about me as I withdraw into the confines of my room. Lack of appetite, disrupted sleep patterns, and neglecting regular exercise at the gym for weeks now characterize my daily routine. Getting out of bed seems like an insurmountable task.\n\nBeing a Black trans man, I am fortunate to have a therapist who is both excellent at her job and a person of color like myself. However, doubts linger in my mind about whether anyone can truly help me overcome this darkness within me. While I confide in her about most issues, disclosing my suicidal thoughts remains beyond reach due to embarrassment and fear that she may be obligated to report it – an outcome involving law enforcement that would only exacerbate matters for me.\n\nMost days, the overwhelming desire not to exist consumes me entirely.

This might seem trivial to others, but what sent me spiraling into a mix of rage, sorrow, and utter disillusionment with the world was my parents deciding to confine the kittens in their bedroom so they wouldn't disturb my sleep by being on my bed at night. Due to COVID restrictions, I had been solely responsible for looking after their new kittens for a few weeks before coming home to be with them within our support bubble. After investing almost three weeks into caring for them by myself, they've grown quite attached to me. I had planned to spend a week here (even taking time off work) with the expectation that my parents would be interested in spending quality time together despite the presence of the kittens. However, they haven't shown any interest in bonding with the kittens and instead have become resentful and irritated when the kittens seek my company. The kittens are currently isolated in my parents' room without access to water or a litter box, which has left me seething with anger. Is it unreasonable for me to feel this way? How did this situation end up pushing me to tears alone in the garage at 3 am, battling between feeling guilty for trying to assist them and resisting the temptation to wander aimlessly into the night because I'm indifferent towards what might happen? Part of me almost wishes for something unfortunate just so I wouldn't have to contend with these thoughts anymore; it'd all just be over then.

Despite what my family believes and insists on, the driving force behind my desire to end things isn't solely related to my past with my ex-partner. It's this terrible affliction that's consuming me, I can't fathom why this is happening to me. I understand that my ex doesn't value me and disregarded the deceitful actions she engaged in behind my back. Sometimes I even wonder if stumbling upon that explicit video was somehow intentional on her part. Although I'm furious and filled with the urge to retaliate physically against her, I also don't entirely blame her. Discovering that my spouse harbored disturbing inclinations towards minors and cross-dressing added an unprecedented layer of distress. While she initiated the separation discourse several months after these revelations unfolded, it had been festering within me long before our confrontation. While I acknowledge that experiences like this are unfortunately not uncommon between partners, this issue extends beyond just the aftermath of my failed relationship - it intertwines with a deep-seated struggle that predates even knowing her. Despite my genuine efforts to contain it, this affliction only seems to escalate unabated. It adds an unbearable weight to see my family attributing everything solely to the breakdown of my marriage or past relationship. Even after leaving a detailed note outlining my decision, it seems my mother hasn't disclosed the entire truth to my brother. Their refusal to address and acknowledge the root cause exacerbates an already dire situation - brushing it off does more harm than good.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" in"}
{"prompt":"I despise all forms of entertainment – music, television, and movies. They all seem to thrive while my existence feels increasingly unbearable. My boyfriend constantly bombards me with music, mindless TV shows, and multiple movies each day. Even going out for a meal feels like a chore, deciding what to wear is a constant struggle as I feel unattractive and inadequate. At 40, I find myself comparing to my mother who appears more put-together than I'll ever be. The silence within me is deafening, nudging me towards thoughts of self-harm.\n\nFeel nothing but loathing towards my partner. His words pierce through me daily, unintentionally cutting deep into my soul. His casual remarks about changing lives or seeking mentorship from his stepmom leave me feeling mute and incompetent. The thought of getting dressed seems pointless when I believe I'll never work again. As he prepares to return home soon, the temptation to end it all grows stronger. He expects me to choose a restaurant tonight as if everything is normal when inside, my world is falling apart.\n\nIt's time for me to act – only a few hours remain before I can make my decision. The nearby bridge spans 24 miles calling out to me as my mind screams in agony. Despite his desire to marry me, I lack decent attire or a job - just waiting in nervous anticipation with nothing but monosyllabic responses at my disposal.\n\nThe fruitless quest for stable employment consumes me as I browse through job listings routinely. It feels like a futile endeavor given the lack of references, appropriate work attire, or relevant experience rendering me unemployable in the eyes of society.\n\nThis isn't about mental illness; it's about circumstance. It infuriates me how those around me believe professional help can miraculously make everything better without grasping the crippling weight of unemployment and aimlessness on my shoulders. They are content in their jobs or retirement while I seethe with resentment towards them.\n\nTomorrow seems like the day – no career prospects, no opportunities on the horizon; merely existing daily without purpose or direction as things continue to deteriorate rapidly.\n\nAt 40, it feels like rock bottom has been reached - devoid of optimism regarding finding employment or filling the void in my life meaningfully. A monthly allowance from family barely sustains me but won't last forever; limited clothing options and perpetual silence define each mundane day spent with an incessantly chatty boyfriend whose presence accentuates my emptiness pushing thoughts of self-destruction into sharper focus.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

I don't think so. Perhaps the fear of missing out on certain experiences? But I've already missed out on a lot, so that can't be it. It seems like I wasn't truly ready until now. As I write this, a loaded gun rests by my side, and the outcome once I share this is uncertain. The possibility of death or a failed attempt doesn't faze me anymore. The perceived risk is outweighed by the potential reward. I refuse to grant myself further opportunities or make excuses; I am determined to end things by shooting myself.

{"prompt":"All I yearn for is to feel like a regular person. Sometimes, I wish I had been born without ADHD, as it has been a lifelong struggle for me. Initially, I was told that ADHD tends to subside during puberty, but in my case, it only intensified over time. It transformed me into the kind of unfocused and easily distracted individual often depicted on television. Everything feels like a chore unless it captivates my intense focus, which is rare. This condition has led me to lose touch with social norms and has caused me to exhibit behavior that aligns with hurtful stereotypes. Regrettably, I've made inappropriate gestures towards girls influenced by anime obsessions in the past, which has labeled me as odd and erratic by others.\n\nI find solace in repetitive behaviors such as reading the same books repetitively, but this pattern of behavior has made me an easy target for relentless bullying since middle school. It was during this time that I first expressed thoughts of wanting to end my life, and unfortunately, these feelings have stayed with me ever since. Interacting with people frightens me not because of meeting them but due to the fear of losing them. Despite having advantages in life like being white, male, attending private school with affluent parents who supported my college education fully sans debt, I feel like they have all gone to waste.\n\nI hold two degrees that haven't proved beneficial in securing a stable future. Even a job opportunity at my mother's office ended abruptly when they let me go after my trial period due to my struggles with suicidal thoughts. Over everything else, what resonates deeply within me is an overwhelming sense of loneliness and detachment from others. My awkward communication style often leads me to say things that are misunderstood or offensive without intending to do so.\n\nIt pains me greatly that relationships I've attempted have crumbled shortly after starting. Despairingly, therapy hasn't provided the relief I sought, and relying on medication takes away any fleeting moments of happiness that exist for me. The thought of ending my life lingers persistently in my mind as a means to escape feeling like a burden on those around me. The continuous weight of existing without purpose or connection seems insurmountable at times.\n\nIn essence, all I desire is some sense of normalcy and peace within myself. The prospect of finding love seems unattainable given my insecurities about physical appearance and lack of social aptitude. The agony intensifies when faced with the recurring failures in forming lasting relationships - leaving me drained emotionally.\n\nThe idea of erasing myself from existence crosses my mind frequently lately; however, the concern remains about how it would impact those closest to me after I'm gone - especially burdening my parents further beyond what they've already endured through my hardships.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

{"prompt":"'Struggling to find any motivation at all. I feel completely drained, empty, and devoid of any spark within me, and nothing seems to alleviate this. I'm exhausted from hearing people talk about how professional help works for everyone when it clearly hasn't for me. Sometimes, the fact that I'm a virgin makes me contemplate ending it all. It's a feeling of profound inadequacy. It pains me to pour my heart out here because all I get in return is trite advice. My chronic depression is the root cause of my perpetual loneliness and virginity – it saps the life out of me and renders me unappealing, not because of my lack of sexual experience but due to a family history rife with this insidious condition. My inner turmoil has left me feeling lifeless, bland, and withdrawn; no amount of self-improvement or socializing can assail the fortress that depression has built within me. Confidence eludes me under the weight of depression's grip on my existence. The monotony of life, the grind of a mundane job coupled with crippling depression that greets me upon returning home make existence unbearable. Even physical fitness does little to alter this reality; confidence is a luxury beyond reach when one is shackled by depression's chains. Life feels like a prison without reprieve – an endless cycle of monotonous routines devoid of joy or purpose. The prospect of trying new things feels futile when the real battle lies within – battling an abyss devoid of energy or ambition. Constantly besieged by feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness, I find myself imprisoned by circumstances beyond my control. The energy required to navigate through this maze called life continually escapes me; my efforts seemingly lead nowhere as academic pursuits falter despite relentless studying, physical strength remains elusive despite dedicated gym sessions, and social interactions falter due to an inner void that leaves me feeling hollow inside. The weighty burden placed on my shoulders goes unrecognized by those closest to me who perceive laziness where there exists only exhaustion and despair. Feeling misunderstood fuels thoughts of leaping off the nearby cliff as a desperate means to escape this unending torment. The barrage of insincere advice received when expressing these sentiments further deepens the sense of isolation and incomprehension that shrouds my daily struggles.\n\nIt's astounding how paralyzing depression can be in its grip on one's life – a catalyst for pervasive thoughts about suicide that often consume my mind. Faced with severe depression and anhedonia, each day presents an insurmountable challenge towards constructing a better future for myself; holding down employment becomes an insurmountable hurdle alongside grappling with feelings inadequacy stemming from perceived intellectual limitations and physical unattractiveness - though beauty remains subjective as exemplified by differing societal standards exemplified by models within the industry . A profound sense of ennui pervades every facet of daily existence; even intimate relationships seem like unattainable fantasies as depressive lethargy smothers any potential sparks within me.\n\nEngaging with life under such circumstances feels utterly futile, reduced at times to seeking solace through fleeting moments found in video game escapism which too quickly lose their allure adding yet another layer onto sthe suffocating void . The prospect offered by well-meaning individuals to try new experiences serves as little consolation in face pf pervasive depresion regardless what endeavours are undertaken.'\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

Even when I enjoy the company of my cousins, I can't shake the feeling of not quite belonging and being a burden on them. Currently, my only close friend is a former teacher. There have been moments when I've contemplated self-harm but found myself unable to follow through, which leaves me feeling cowardly.

There's a possibility that you are not particularly religious. Perhaps you catch yourself fantasizing about how having a partner could change things for the better. Maybe your relationship with your parents has been strained or overwhelming, whether due to lack of affection or excessive love in a detrimental manner. It's possible that thoughts of using drugs or alcohol to ease your stress have crossed your mind. However, deep down, the idea of taking drastic actions scares you.

Recognize that any suicidal impulses are merely a coping mechanism, a method to deceive your mind into seeking solace in fiction rather than facing life head-on. Embrace the fact that your fear outweighs any courage or determination required for such drastic actions. Remember that self-loathing is a common struggle; even those who appear not to hate themselves may not truly love themselves but rather maintain a facade as a means of avoiding self-reflection.\n\nIn the event that you reconsider and decide on a different course of action, don't keep it to yourself quietly. If at all contemplating acting out, make it known in an impactful manner – not with silence but with a loud statement before departing.

He had a negative experience during a brief stay at a psychiatric ward previously due to severe insomnia.\n\nHe seems to be waiting for destiny to provide him with a miraculous sign or purpose while I believe that creating one's own purpose is essential.

{"prompt":"I'm an 18-year-old male and I find it difficult to express what's going on inside me. I've been engaging in self-harm for quite a while now, starting with small actions that have now left my body covered in scars from head to toe. The physical pain helps distract me from the emotional turmoil that I've been feeling since the age of 12. Recently, I was discharged from the military due to mental health issues and was referred to a psychiatrist for an assessment. The diagnosis she gave me included being labelled as a sociopath and someone who engages in self-mutilation.\n\nLately, thoughts of ending my life have been consuming me. Nothing seems to bring me joy, and I struggle to feel any love for others, resorting to lies and causing harm without any justification. Despite being engaged to a girl since last summer, who annoys me but cares deeply for me, the connection with a previous girlfriend has resurfaced. She has undergone significant traumas like depression and multiple instances of sexual assault.\n\nUpon reconnecting with her, I found myself drawn to her changed persona and our shared struggles. We spent a night together, breaking through my numbness and experiencing genuine happiness for once. However, following my departure the next morning, my attempts to reach out were met with silence. It turns out she had made a failed suicide attempt by cutting her wrists while intoxicated, leading to her confinement in an institution with an uncertain release date.\n\nDespite this ordeal, she agreed to pursue a relationship with me but remains undecided about her will to live. We both reached an agreement that if she decides on ending her life, we would do it together. In this confusion and heartache, losing her would shatter any will I have left to continue living; ultimately leading me towards thinking about taking my own life as well.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

{"prompt":"Are we headed there? Feeling in a really dark place. The reality is tough to accept. You may be grappling with depression, feeling like you lack skills that could be meaningful to others and struggling to find purpose. It's possible that religion doesn't offer solace. Perhaps you find yourself wistfully imagining that having a partner could change things for the better. Maybe your relationship with your parents has left emotional scars - either they weren't as supportive as you needed or their love felt suffocating. Drugs or alcohol might have crossed your mind as a way to numb the pain. However, deep down, the idea of taking drastic actions like suicide scares you. These thoughts could be a coping mechanism, serving as a distraction from reality and preventing any real action. Rest assured, the fear is actually stronger than any fleeting burst of suicidal courage or conviction. It might seem like self-loathing is universal, with those who appear confident possibly just putting on a facade to shield themselves from self-reflection.\n\nIf you ever reconsider and feel compelled to take drastic steps, remember not to fade into the shadows quietly. If you decide to go down that road, make a statement, leave a mark - not for attention but for validation of your worth and a rebellion against an unjust world. There are more constructive outlets, ways to channel frustration and anger without causing harm. Instead of seeking destructive means like producing explosives at home or targeting power plants, perhaps consider seeking help or finding healthier outlets for these intense emotions.\n\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" in"}

My social circle is limited to one friend, and although his intentions are pure, hearing about his effortless social experiences in college only intensifies my frustration. He shares how he disliked college but found solace in forming connections that helped him cope. Meanwhile, I feel isolated, commuting in silence each day without engaging with anyone. It's disheartening to see how effortlessly he connects with others – especially women initiating conversations with him effortlessly. It's discouraging to compare myself to him; college seems like an unattainable goal now after my second significant setback.\n\nThe constant dread and anxiety have become unbearable. Mornings serve as a harsh reminder of my obligations, leading to a paralyzing sense of despair. I struggle to function unless enveloped in darkness. While my family means well and provides for me, I've lost the emotional connection with them. Despite my mother's care, I feel empty and frustrated, unable to muster any motivation. Even activities I once enjoyed like storytelling now feel like insurmountable tasks. Maintaining interest in reading or committing to personal hygiene routines feels impossible.\n\nThe recurring thought of where I see myself in five years brings only one bleak prospect – nonexistence. The notion of functioning within society eludes me as anxiety and depression consume my thoughts incessantly. It seems as though success hinges on fortuitous circumstances which have evaded me thus far. While some believe we control our destinies, I disagree – the impetus for change often arises externally rather than internally. Motivation appears to stem from favorable conditions rather than sheer willpower or desire.\n\nLife appears as a series of missed opportunities for me while others seem blessed by luck at every turn.

Spare me the cliché reassurances that things will undoubtedly improve. I've been striving for a significant period now.

Each time I allow myself to hope for something, the subsequent disappointment cuts even deeper. If only I knew how to numb my emotions so that I could accept whatever little life throws at me. My upbringing was an ordeal. It's likely the root of my current turmoil. Betrayed by friends and subjected to abuse by my parents, it has taught me not to place trust in any human being - not in friends, nor family, as they all possess the capacity to betray and cause harm if one doesn't conform to their expectations. My self-trust is shattered too; ultimately, I am the saboteur of my own life and have committed regrettable acts as well, resorting to bullying other children for temporary relief from my own insecurities. In essence, I resemble those very friends and family members whom I criticize. Perhaps suffering is what I deserve - why then do none of these so-called \"friends\" endure a similar fate? Maybe it falls upon me to make them suffer as well. Romance has never come my way either. Yes, it might seem trivial that I lament over relationships, but it signifies more than mere companionship to me and proving challenging in ways beyond others' comprehension. The societal obsession with my virginity has forced me into falsehoods among peers just to ward off ridicule - a typical display of how friendships can morph into manipulative dependencies wherein conformity becomes a shield against being ostracized or ridiculed.\nThe idea of a woman genuinely caring for me appears ludicrous now - akin to a cruel jest played upon me repeatedly.Discovering an existence free from such entanglements would be a relief; alas, familial ties offer no solace either: they exist merely due to two individuals' primal desires without regard for nurturing true emotional connections.Surely love exists within this framework, demonstrated through disciplinary measures such as the beatings endured during childhood supposedly in keeping with parental benevolence.As if that weren't enough,I must also come to terms with being cast out should my beliefs diverge from their imposed religious doctrine.Unconditional love turns conditional once resistance surfaces.Yet,I'd sooner face death than capitulate  before others-whether friends,family or romantic interests.So,is there anything worth living for?Family?Those who brought me into this world yet struggled raising me?Friends?Those who tormented and coerced me into conformity against my true self?Love?An illusion reserved for those who outshine me in every aspect.Do we dare label this ordeal called life'Perhaps the end is nearer than anticipated.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

Throughout this school year, my mental well-being has deteriorated significantly. Besides my parents, I have barely communicated with anyone else except on rare occasions. There are numerous assignments that I have yet to complete, and it's almost unbelievable that I am somehow managing a C- in my most challenging classes. Upon realizing the extent of the unfinished work that now cannot be submitted due to the syllabus guidelines that I failed to read stating no late submissions after our last test, I am at a loss. The looming AP Biology exam scheduled for Thursday is causing me even more distress.

I understand logically that it's just a matter of enduring two more weeks, and then it will all be behind me. However, the hardship of these moments is crushing me. Just last Thursday, I went through another AP exam experience where all I can recall is studying tirelessly while tears soaked my pillow each night; it's disheartening to realize that suicide has even crossed my mind when previously it was never a consideration throughout this challenging year and beyond. Honestly, if not for my parents, I wouldn't care about any of this. They hold high expectations of me; although never explicitly stated, I sense their anticipation for greatness within me. They acknowledge my intelligence, which I also acknowledge; however, they are unaware of the turmoil plaguing my mind all this time. Growing older has brought forth conversations from my parents about the future more frequently: what college to attend, which major to pursue, what career path to embark on - questions to which I have no answers; okay? This inner confusion has been brewing within me for quite some time now - an internal struggle that was previously overshadowed by attempts at self-preservation since the onset of quarantine. My circle of 'friends' has dissipated over time; ordinarily engaging in activities that bring joy seems fruitless now as all those coping mechanisms seem to have failed me suddenly during this trying period. It's daunting how everything that once provided solace as mental supports over the years has crumbled leaving me feeling abandoned and lost. What steps should I take next? Undeniably pathetic is how inadequate and young - only 15 years old - sharing all these accumulated burdens might make feel exposed here. Consuming stories about genuine struggles from other people can't shake off the overwhelming sense of insignificance creeping inwards with questioning thoughts - after all, we all meet our end eventually right? So why should any of it matter? Why should any kind of emotional investment matter anymore? Has anyone reached a point where even tears seem\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

{"prompt":"I feel incredibly isolated and overwhelmed by my loneliness. Watching my friends all find love while I continually come up empty-handed despite my efforts is exhausting. All I truly yearn for is to find a genuine mutual connection with someone who values me as much as I value them. While I can usually find contentment in my own company, there's an undeniable sense of emptiness without that special bond. Despite repeatedly putting myself out there, it seems that luck is never on my side in this aspect of my life. The weight of these disappointments has become unbearable, leading me to contemplate ending it all each day. The preparations for such a drastic step are already in place – the note, the finances, the legal matters – everything sorted. I've reached out before seeking hope for what the future may hold, only to be met with disappointment time and time again. Regrettably, this message may serve as my final farewell.

This has to stop. You're wasting MY HARD-EARNED MONEY. From now on, buy your own food since you'll only vomit it out anyway. This money could serve a better purpose, and don't think about telling your mother because this mess is all on you,\" scolded my father. \"I had a great time with my girlfriend and her daughters today.

{"prompt":"After confiding in my family, I find myself in a state of profound discomfort. The decision to move back in with my parents stems from my acknowledgment that I lack the mental stability required to live independently. Unmasking my inner struggles to my parents was a deeply humiliating experience, leaving me with a sense of shame so intense it feels suffocating. As much as I dislike the idea of residing with them, it seemed like the only alternative to pursuing a suicidal course of action. The overwhelming nausea at the revelation of my inner turmoil nearly led me to the brink, but in a moment of sheer desperation, I poured out everything to my mom via text. Consequently, I am now on the verge of dropping out of college and orchestrating a return to my childhood home. \nThe apprehension that engulfs me springs from the fact that I dread living under their roof; a decision which fills me with foreboding as I cannot fathom enduring it. A creeping feeling of regret creeps upon me, almost like a shadow, heightening my desire for an easy way out. The vulnerability exposed during this familial exchange has left me feeling utterly exposed and overwhelmed.\nThe persistent thought of overdosing has haunted me tonight, though deep down, I knew such an attempt wouldn't be fatal. Nevertheless, the allure held sway over me, tempting me toward oblivion. My current state of being is one plagued by apathy and defeat - reflected in my neglect of academic responsibilities and obligations due to my inability to even rise from bed.\nNavigating this dark chasm seems insurmountable as no remedy appears efficacious. Even worse is confronting the reality that ambivalence toward recovery has taken root within me. An option that crossed my mind was seeking admission into an inpatient facility but recoil at the mere thought of divulging this plan to my parents.\nSilent suffering has been my companion for too long now; it seems as if I have reached a critical juncture where the weight becomes unbearable. Contemplations arise - should I inform my parents about deferring studies for this semester to prioritize healing? Yet, their likely response pointing towards employment failing to acknowledge the depth of despair within.\nIn this unending limbo between living and succumbing lies an agonizing tug-of-war being fought within me - torn between mortality and survival but unable to commit fully either way.\nThroughout today, eyes have incessantly grazed over pill bottles although cognizant that there is not enough for a lethal outcome; still tempted by thoughts transcending reason.\nA cry for genuine help reverberates through every fiber of my being as sustaining this facade becomes increasingly unbearable. Concealed behind masks unseen by those closest to me - parents, family, friends - lies a mental labyrinth so profound that words fail to illuminate its depths.\nWhile recognition dawns on me regarding irrationality surfacing through contemplating overdose merely as a plea for aid at this juncture; such realization holds little sway over thoughts focused solely on reaching out even amidst despair.\nDoes anyone else resonate with this profound sense of detachment - teetering on indifference toward life itself?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}
{"prompt":"I am deeply troubled by my current situation but lack the courage to address it. I am currently in a work placement, and once this six-month period ends, I am at a loss as to what my future holds. I feel inadequate as I lack the necessary skills, and the reliance on job references and constant pressure to excel at work are sources of great distress to me. Despite numerous attempts, I struggle to meet expectations and even simple job interviews pose a significant challenge. This cycle is becoming unbearable, where I constantly feel insufficient for job roles yet desperately need income. The high cost of living and housing complexities in the UK only add to my frustration. I find myself easily overwhelmed, unable to assert myself when treated unfairly, a situation that seems all too common for me. The daily task of preparing for work fills me with dread; I feel trapped in a relentless pursuit where suicide appears as the only escape route. While other issues persist, financial struggles currently dominate my concerns as my intellectual shortcomings lead to rejection for job references. My lack of initiative and poor memory exacerbate these challenges, leaving me disinterested in any pursuits. Despite efforts to learn professional communication skills through videos and observation, I still falter in formal conversations with frequent pauses causing intense embarrassment. A profound sense of emptiness engulfs me, accentuating the weight of life's burdens as each day grows more arduous at 22 years old. The mounting pressure is frightening as thoughts of drastic measures like hanging cross my mind but remain unacted upon due to inner turmoil. Periodically sharing my emotions about this harsh reality on this platform has become a coping mechanism for me; recently experiencing belittlement from a colleague only deepened my isolation as forming connections or friendships proves elusive due to my inherent social awkwardness and hypersensitivity.

Still, there's that slim chance, one in a billion maybe, where things could turn around. But you know what's more probable than that? Life taking a turn for the worse.

Part of me feels convinced about my decision, while another part hesitates. It's frustrating, especially since I can't rent a car yet due to credit card restrictions for out-of-state rentals. So, I had to clear my card balance last night and now waiting for the payment to go through before I can use it.

While I am not currently making any plans to act on these thoughts and doubt I would even be successful if I did, the sense of deserving to not exist is overwhelming me. I find myself wallowing in self-pity and lamenting my circumstances without taking any meaningful steps to improve my situation. This lack of initiative not only disappoints those who may wish to support me but also reinforces my belief that I do not merit a better life. My actions seem restricted to merely complaining about my loneliness rather than actively seeking connection with others. Even if I were to reach out, part of me believes it would be futile as I am consumed by feelings of worthlessness and self-absorption. The idea of burdening others with my issues has plagued me for far too long, and I almost wish for someone to metaphorically extinguish the mess that is my existence. Despite the genuine efforts of kind strangers offering their assistance, I struggle to perceive a path towards improvement as it feels like this misery is all there is for me. This realization weighs heavily on me, reinforcing the notion that maybe this darkness is where I belong.

I check in on him regularly, ensuring he's coping and not contemplating drastic actions. Uncertain if anyone else is providing support, I have to assume it's just me and his therapist. The dilemma lies in the fact that I too battle suicidal thoughts yet have never confided in anyone about it. It's becoming challenging to hide this from him as I encourage him to persevere. Initially, when I urged him to keep fighting, I struggled to believe my own words, and even now, though primarily offering friendship and support, it feels disingenuous to advocate for the value of life when I'm grappling with my own desire to end mine.

It may sound trivial to anyone else, but what triggered a surge of anger, sadness, and hopelessness in me was when my parents decided to keep the kittens confined in their room with them instead of allowing them to sleep on my bed at night. Due to COVID restrictions, I had been solely responsible for looking after their new kittens for a few weeks until I could finally visit them as part of our support bubble arrangement. Naturally, after nearly three weeks of caring for them on my own, the kittens have become quite attached to me. Despite planning to spend a week at their place (I even took time off work), I realize now that I was overly optimistic in expecting my parents to willingly spend time with me in the presence of these kittens.\n\nThe fact that they show no interest in bonding with the kittens but then display jealousy and irritation towards them seeking my attention has left me infuriated. The kittens are currently locked in my parents' room without access to essentials like water or a litter tray, and this treatment has only fueled my anger. Is it wrong for me to feel this way? Why is this particular situation driving me to tears in the garage at 3 am? I'm facing emotional turmoil as I'm made to feel guilty for simply helping out and resisting the urge to disappear into the night without caring about what happens to me. Some days, I almost wish for something unfortunate to happen so that all these overwhelming thoughts would come to an end once and for all.\n\nMy relationship with my parents has always been strained due to emotional and spiritual abuse that traces back years, making it difficult for me to be around them. Being here only intensifies my desire not to exist. With nowhere else to turn, I feel utterly defeated.

Amidst everything going on right now, I've spent hours trying to find a way out or a solution but nothing seems clear.\n\nI long for an end, a release from all this pain; if only I could drift away into an undisturbed sleep.

The urge to scream and weep is strong, yet all that follows are emergency calls to push the problem aside. It feels as though my body is surrendering, despite me not actively harming myself. Perhaps this is how it was always meant to be – a constant struggle with no hope for improvement in sight. The growing desperation leads me to contemplate ending my own life; the thought of finding peace only when unconscious haunts me.

{"prompt":"I am reaching out for support. It has been a month since my partner of a decade abruptly departed on my birthday. Without warning, they packed their bags and informed me they were leaving. The lack of closure has left me bewildered, as I am still in the dark about the reasons behind their decision. Despite enduring physical and emotional abuse from her, I have never confided in anyone due to the emasculating stigma attached to such disclosures. It is challenging to admit that my female partner resorts to violence during our arguments at home. She had persistently urged me to seek therapy for years, and while I finally began counseling during the pandemic, my efforts to improve myself and my mental well-being were met with disdain from her. Now, in my thirties, I feel like a purposeless existence without any motivation to carry on. She departed with all our mutual friends, leaving me utterly isolated. After relocating across the country to be near my family in an attempt to heal, I quickly realized why I kept my distance from them – it only exacerbated my mental anguish. I found more solace being alone with just my dog in my car without a destination in mind.\n\nI have ceased taking my prescribed medication and turned to heavy drinking, a behavior I had successfully restrained for nearly a year. Today marked the last of my Ativan supply, which has been instrumental in preventing a downward spiral. Anticipating reluctance from my psychiatrist to renew the prescription leads me to believe that this might be the end for me. Some individuals may find their life's purpose through suicide, a realization that oddly brings me a sense of acceptance.\n\nRegrettably, sharing these thoughts openly with either my therapist or psychiatrist seems unfeasible out of fear of involuntary commitment. Knowing myself well enough convinces me that I will resort to deception just to evade such an outcome, ultimately propelling me closer towards self-harm. It bewilders me that those whom I believed loved me could inflict such pain upon me.\n\nPerhaps this is a form of karmic retribution indicating that it's time for me to depart from this world – nature's way of signaling my imminent demise. Realistically speaking, I do not anticipate any responses or readership of this post; however, loneliness pervades every aspect of my being.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

I’m feeling deeply troubled as I believe there is something fundamentally wrong with me, causing me to question my own safety.\n\nTo provide some background, I am typically a highly empathetic individual who has devoted my career to aiding others. However, I have a heartbreaking history of childhood trauma, adult experiences of sexual assault and domestic abuse, leading to my diagnosis of CPTSD, depression, and anxiety on multiple occasions. Despite actively seeking help and engaging in various forms of therapy, the challenges persist. Compounding this is the fact that in my home country—an environment fraught with danger—I am uncertain about my future due to pending legal decisions. The constant onslaught of flashbacks, prolonged panic attacks, nightmares, disrupted eating and sleeping patterns has been unrelenting for a considerable period. In documenting my experiences meticulously, I have observed that over the last six months, I have experienced less than four hours of genuine respite per day without fail.\n\nAcknowledging the current state of affairs leaves me feeling profoundly unsettled; it appears that within me resides a brokenness so profound that it is manifesting in harmful behaviors towards others. Despite severing ties with an abusive ex-partner, I find myself compulsively tracking and contacting them—a behavior akin to harassment which deeply troubles me. It pains me to admit that my actions mirror some aspects of the mistreatment inflicted upon me by past abusers; attempts to redirect my focus away from this person have proven futile as intrusive thoughts persist endlessly. The realization that I am directly causing suffering to an individual weighs heavily on me.\n\nLooking ahead, without concrete assurances about residing in a secure environment or observing tangible improvements in my mental well-being by the conclusion of February, suicide looms as a distressing option. The specter of physical vulnerability—coupled with uncertainties surrounding access to adequate mental health care—compel me towards this harrowing decision. It grieves me deeply to acknowledge that not only am I unable to safeguard myself effectively but also inadvertently pose risks to those who care about me. My internal turmoil and unresolved traumas render me an unsafe presence for others; grappling with these demons feels insurmountable at this juncture.\n\nExpressing remorse for unfulfilled aspirations compounds the anguish; there are ambitious research projects within reach boasting transformative potential for numerous individuals in need. Despite possessing intelligence and demonstrating relentless dedication in shaping my identity thus far, the magnitude of emotional distress eclipses these prospects indefinitely.\n\nIn sharing these sentiments, I welcome any perspectives or insights from those willing to extend their support during this tumultuous period. Acknowledging my fractured state and potential for causing harm reinforces existing distress; therefore echoing these sentiments is unnecessary and only deepens existing pain levels.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

A major argument erupted within my family, laying bare all our underlying issues. I've been battling suicidal thoughts for the past six years; my first attempt was at 14, a harrowing experience that I narrowly survived. Since then, there have been a few instances where I came close but never followed through. Returning to my home country, I find myself grappling with the same turmoil. My girlfriend has been my sole support through all this pain, yet my family disapproves of her. Initially, they were running a school aiding those unable to afford their visas, but once they objected to my affection for her, they ceased their support and she had to return home. Despite our mutual longing, circumstances prevent us from being together. This merely scratches the surface of an overwhelmingly complex situation. The prospect of saving enough money to visit her seems unattainable as I cannot currently return to Australia. Concealing the fact that I still communicate with her from my family adds another layer of difficulty to this already painful scenario. It's disheartening; I feel like there's no purpose left for me in striving for happiness when all that remains is a solitary figure in a dimly lit room yearning for a stroke of good fortune. Watched others progress with their lives after dropping out of school makes me feel left behind in the shadows as they reminisce about their partners while having them by their side. Hope lingers within me that one day we'll be united even after enduring all these trials and maintaining a long-distance relationship for over a year with only three fleeting months together before her departure.As someone raised in a Christian household that deems our union against divine will, it's perplexing; how could love created by God not find favor in His eyes?

{"prompt":"I feel like giving up. Hi, I'm a stranger here but I need to let this out. My family recently had a huge argument about our issues and it's overwhelming. I've been battling suicidal thoughts for about 6 years now, with a serious attempt at the age of 14 that I barely survived. Since then, there have been a few instances where I almost succumbed, but somehow stayed alive. I returned to my home country only to find myself in the same struggles. The one person who has been my rock through all this pain is my girlfriend, but my family doesn't approve of her. They used to run a school for those struggling with visa fees, including her, but when they found out about us, they shut it down and she had to leave. We constantly talk about being together, but circumstances seem to conspire against us. It feels like an impossible situation. I can't save up enough money to visit her in Australia and haven't told my family that we still keep in touch. It's frustrating and I'm losing sight of any purpose in trying to seek happiness when all I feel like is a solitary figure in a dim room waiting for something good to happen.\n\nSeeing everyone around me progress with their lives while holding onto their partners makes me feel left behind. Despite dropping out of school, I cling onto the hope that one day we'll overcome these obstacles and finally be together for real after enduring a year of long-distance relationship with just three months spent together before she had to leave.\n\nDealing with a Christian family that views our relationship as against God's will adds another layer of complexity. Personally, I believe that if God is the source of love, then love itself should be embraced. Sadly, it's not within my control. The thought of continuing on is losing its appeal; it's been quite a journey but perhaps this world isn’t meant for me after all.\n\nThe agony intensifies as thoughts of her tears pierce through me; feeling trapped and isolated leaves me feeling utterly lost. If there’s one thing I want to convey here: cherish your loved ones – that special someone you would move mountains for – because life is fleeting and not everyone gets that fairy-tale ending as far as my experiences have shown me.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}

However, instead, I find myself here wanting to convey a message that you are not alone. I understand if this sentiment may come across as cliché and prompt internal eye rolls.

{"prompt":"At 14 years old, my sole reason for staying alive is my younger brother. Returning to my home country, Romania, two years ago has subjected me to overwhelming stress, primarily stemming from school pressures in 2019. I found myself devoid of close friendships and often cried myself to sleep, even the activities I once found joy in became dull. The idea of ending my life crossed my mind on multiple occasions, but the love I hold for my little brother always stopped me. He remains my anchor in life. Amidst the pandemic, things slightly improved as I grappled with persistent anxiety. Fortunately, I found solace in a supportive friend who lent a compassionate ear and substantially aided me through my struggles.\n\nHowever, as of late, the situation has significantly deteriorated. Overwhelmed by mounting stress and anxiety, I feel paralyzed and devoid of any motivation. Additionally, last year I came to terms with being both atheistic and bisexual, a reality that sharply contrasts with my deeply religious family and friends. Disclosing this truth to my sole confidant a few weeks ago resulted in him growing distant. He was the only person with whom I felt safe and connected regularly.\n\nThis internal turmoil is consuming me as I fear any attempt to confide in those around me would be met with dismissive responses such as 'it's just a phase' or 'you're young, what could be troubling you?'

I am constantly on edge and prone to explosive reactions over the smallest inconveniences, regardless of the circumstances.

I am still undecided and have not yet taken any action beyond contemplating my options at home. However, I am starting to believe that it would be more beneficial for society if I were to remain confined for the remainder of my days.

Shortly after the start of 2021, my father's acquaintance arranged a gathering at a private pool to celebrate his daughter's business achievement, and our family was invited along with a few other close acquaintances. I had reservations about attending due to the ongoing concerns around Covid-19, but it was deemed impolite to decline given that it was a private event.\n\nEvery moment there felt excruciating. Nobody seemed interested in engaging with me, not even people my age. Instead, they were preoccupied with drinking and displaying affection in the pool, while the adults indulged in laughter and karaoke. I felt isolated and overlooked, and when I tried to distance myself from the group for the whole evening, no one bothered to check on me. The entire episode sent me spiraling downward. It was clear that nobody cared about my presence; their glances reeked of pity. I resented the forced attempts to involve me in conversations at the behest of the adults. The moment the grown-ups looked away, it was as though I ceased to exist.\n\nThe environment became increasingly distressing, overwhelming me to a point where I sought refuge in the bathroom for an hour simply because the noise level became unbearable. I fear sounding like I am seeking attention or appearing overly sensitive, but I experienced such intense feelings of isolation and judgment during those two days that it continues to haunt me today. The prospect of being perceived similarly by my peers during virtual classes terrifies me - what if they hold similar opinions about me while their cameras are turned off? This inexplicable impact has started interfering with my academic performance since numerous assignments necessitate interactions with classmates and instructors.\n\nI despise this sensation and harbor self-loathing for allowing a seemingly trivial incident to affect me so profoundly.

{"prompt":"After confiding in my family about my struggles, I find myself overwhelmed with discomfort. The lack of mental stability I am experiencing has compelled me to return to my parents' home, a decision influenced by the choice between this and the unthinkable alternative of attempting suicide. The vulnerability I revealed to my parents was met with profound mortification and embarrassment, leaving me wishing to escape the situation entirely. Despite the necessity of living with them for now, the prospect fills me with dread as my relationship with my family is strained. The burdensome weight of these circumstances is suffocating, and thoughts of regret plague my mind as I navigate dropping out of college and planning my relocation.\n\nMy psychological distress has led me perilously close to self-harm, evident by a recent impulse to divulge everything through a text to my mother in a desperate plea for help. As I confront the reality of abandoning my academic pursuits and facing the challenges ahead, a sense of hopelessness pervades every aspect of my life. Neglecting responsibilities and withdrawing from social engagements have become routine, signaling a deeper descent into despair.\n\nThe option of seeking inpatient treatment has crossed my mind, although the fear of how this revelation may impact my family adds another layer of distress. After enduring silent suffering for an extended period, it seems as though I have reached an impasse where choices must be made – whether to communicate the need for a hiatus from college to focus on recovery or to consider more intensive interventions like hospitalization.\n\nTrapped between the desire to end this anguish and an inability to take definitive action towards that end, I grapple with thoughts of consuming medication as a cry for attention rather than a sincere attempt at self-harm. The need for urgent assistance looms large on the horizon as the facade of coping crumbles under mounting pressure. Despite being acutely aware that resorting to such extreme measures is far from rational, apathy clouds any rational thought process or concern for consequence.\n\nAs uncertainty grips me and desperation mounts, options dwindle amid confusion over how best to navigate this harrowing landscape of unrelenting mental anguish. The allure of utilizing medication irresponsibly lingers throughout the day as a possible conduit towards receiving immediate help, regardless of its potential repercussions. In a stark realization that articulates an urgent cry for aid beyond superficial expressions of well-being lies an unsettling truth – that those closest to me remain oblivious to the depths of despair engulfing my very existence.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

Despite having tasks at hand, such as completing homework or obtaining my driver's license, I am hindered by a lack of action. I create elaborate scenarios in my mind, forming deep connections with people I barely know. Although I believe I am progressing slowly, the grip of passivity and underachievement weighs heavily on me.\n\nIn moments of vulnerability, thoughts of suicide surface as a consequence of feeling insignificant. My passion for politics and desire to make a positive impact conflict with my inaction, exemplified by my failure to participate in important events like the George Floyd protests. Doubts about my intelligence persist despite strong academic test scores. Comparisons to my peers leave me feeling intellectually inferior and socially inadequate.\n\nAdmitting these struggles is both cathartic and daunting.

My emotional instability and anxiety have driven away or damaged nearly all my relationships, past or potential ones. Recalling my past actions fills me with deep shame, especially seeing how it has cost me many friendships over the last year. Graduating college has further distanced me from people, and being unemployed only adds to my isolation at home as I figure out my next steps. The shame and depression I experience daily due to these issues have pushed me even further into seclusion, making me feel unbearably alone as if every day is a struggle just to survive. My family, particularly my mom, is worried about me as I shut myself away in my room all the time. Eating has become a struggle; my sleep pattern is disrupted, and I haven't been to the gym in weeks.

As a Black trans man, I have a therapist who is supportive and shares my background; however, I often question if there's any hope for me at all.

Although the issues that drove me towards suicidal thoughts have been resolved, I still harbor a desire to end my life because all that remains is this overwhelming sense of life's futility. For a full year, my mind was consumed by the insignificance of things after death and the belief that life holds no real meaning. Even though nothing specific in my current circumstances pushes me towards suicide, I find myself contemplating it nonetheless.

It's an incredibly harmful and ignorant thing to say. The reality is, reaching out for help is a sign of strength and a desire to hold on to any ounce of hope or support available. Being dismissed as attention-seeking when all you're doing is trying to cope and survive is beyond hurtful. The invalidation and neglect from others can be maddening.

{"prompt":"I believe that death is a mercy beyond my reach. Though I have been grappling with suicidal ideation for a considerable time, I was only recently diagnosed with psychological issues. I chose not to burden my parents with the exorbitant fees of psychologists and psychiatrists in our country. I must admit, I have avoided appointments with my psychologist and school counselors compulsively, primarily due to financial constraints. The thought of ending my life has become a familiar companion over the years, almost becoming a disturbing preoccupation. In moments of solitude, I have meticulously planned various methods to end my life within the confines of my home quarantine. From calculating the precise amount of isopropyl alcohol needed for a fatal ingestion to testing the strength of potential anchor points for a noose, every detail has been weighed.\n\nMy mind has wandered to dark places, contemplating drastic actions such as jumping in front of a neighbor's sports car but discarding the idea out of regard for their well-being. Even in considering these drastic measures, ensuring that my family does not intervene before it’s too late has been part of my morbid contemplations – an unintended quarantine pastime.\n\nI struggle to recollect when this cycle of self-loathing began; now, it seems that I despise myself plain and simple. While I can appreciate the beauty and wonder in others effortlessly, extending that compassion towards myself feels impossible. Words like idiot, disappointment, coward, burden, or damaged goods dominate my inner dialogue at moments when vulnerability consumes me entirely.\n\nDespite seeking solace from friends and family and attempting professional help – hindered by financial barriers – nothing seems capable of alleviating the pervasive darkness suffusing every facet of my existence. The passing of my mother earlier this year accentuated feelings of anxiety and self-hatred while extinguishing any remaining flicker within me.\n\nAs suicidal thoughts persist unabated and intensify amid personal turmoil and failed attempts at coping mechanisms like hobbies or professional help, it becomes apparent that suicide lingers as an option - one contemplated yet shunned due to perceived undeservingness. Death appears too lenient a fate for someone who believes they have brought much harm upon others – an easy escape undeservingly granted.\n\nAcknowledging the inherent injustice in seeking an end while others endure pain because of me assumes precedence over self-preservation despite grappling with suicidal contemplations regularly. While lacking clarity on whether this rationale is sufficient to deter ultimate action remains uncertain; it acts as an anchor keeping me tethered amidst turbulent seas.\n\nIn composing this post borne from aimless scrolling through Reddit threads while trapped in cyclical ideations, there exists no clear objective beyond contributing to a discourse resonating with shared anguish and intricate nuances surrounding thoughts on suicide. Soliciting advice seems futile as articulating these deep-seated struggles often proves insurmountable despite genuine efforts from those seeking comprehension.\n\nIn essence, this narrative serves as a mere contribution to an ongoing conversation into which I find myself unwittingly entwined - a fragile attempt at vocalizing sentiments too complex for articulation but too burdensome to carry alone.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

Probably not. My constant state of sadness and feelings of inadequacy have burdened others for far too long now.

It's disheartening to share these thoughts here because the responses I receive are often cliché and unhelpful. My perpetual virginity and solitude are a direct result of my severe chronic depression, which drains me of vitality and leaves me feeling lifeless and withdrawn. It's not about being inexperienced; it's a hereditary trait in my family that, coupled with my lack of appeal, exacerbates my struggles. Suggestions like \"work on your personality\" or \"put yourself out there more\" fall flat because those who offer them fail to grasp that depression renders me unappealing and undesirable at my core. It doesn't always bother me, but when it does, the pain is unbearable enough to make me wish for an end. Moreover, despising life while trudging through a mundane job only to return home consumed by paralyzing depression is a recurring cycle that even physical fitness fails to break.

Encouragements to experiment with new activities only serve as irritants; my malaise runs deep within, sapping all motivation or enthusiasm from my being.

After enduring two lockdowns, the fear of another one undoing any progress lingers heavily. The thought of facing unemployment again due to a potential recession while juggling university obligations weighs me down. The relentless pressure of COVID-19 is pushing me to my breaking point. The inability to travel abroad and witness the world due to restrictions adds to the suffocating feeling of being trapped in a dystopian reality. Is it even reasonable for me to endure this oppressive, monotonous existence? Perhaps considering suicide is not unreasonable given the circumstances. I refuse to be trapped in a collapsing world with no hope in sight. It's challenging to find a purpose for living when it feels like the virus is triumphing over us. Enduring this situation seems increasingly futile; why persist when all efforts seem in vain? It's hard not to feel defeated by these circumstances; life no longer feels vibrant but merely an existence devoid of joy.

A huge part of my anguish stems from the lack of trust in anyone because history has shown that regardless of vows made, abandonment eventually follows. For instance, my ex vowed to weather all storms together but vanished when faced with difficulties. The recurring pattern of being let down after letting someone in makes me question my judgement intensely. Humanity as a whole disappoints me greatly.

Dealing with abusive parents who have financial control over me, leaving me feeling trapped without any sense of autonomy, only adds to the despair.\n\nI lack the independence of having money, a license, or close friends, which amplifies my feelings of inadequacy and worthlessness. My self-perception aligns with feeling like a failure, believing that death might be the only resolution.

The weight of despair has been too heavy for too long, and no amount of medication seems to make a difference. My outlook seems bleak, and self-loathing consumes me.

There's no drive or hope for what lies ahead; barely scraping through high school with doubts about college while also grappling with a potential Asperger's diagnosis - it all adds up.

Sharing almost everything about my struggles with my parents was humiliating and distressing, making me wish I could disappear. While I dislike the idea of living with them, it seemed like a better option than resorting to suicide. The thought of what my parents now know makes me physically ill. There was a moment when suicide seemed imminent, but out of desperation, I poured my heart out to my mom via text, leading me to drop out of college and arrange to move back home. The impending return fills me with dread since living with my family is something I find intolerable. It's a decision I fear regretting deeply. The desire for an easy way out feels overwhelming.\n\nI'm struggling with revealing the extent of my despair to those close to me and feeling lost on what steps to take next. Tonight, the temptation to take a large quantity of pills was strong even though deep down, I knew it wouldn't be fatal. My willingness to continue this existence is dwindling by the day. Neglecting my college responsibilities has led me down a path where failing every course seems inevitable. Everything feels bleak; getting out of bed itself is a monumental task. Existing in solitude has become unbearable; self-care has slipped beyond reach. The descent into this darkness has left me feeling utterly hopeless.\n\nThe thought of seeking treatment through inpatient care crossed my mind, but the dread of my parents discovering this choice fills me with shame. Enduring silent suffering for so long has pushed me towards a breaking point that seems impossible to ignore any longer. Should I inform my parents about dropping out for the semester in order to focus on recovery? Or would they instead attribute it solely to unemployment and pressure me into finding a job? Is returning home the solution? Perhaps checking myself into a hospital is the answer? Caught between wanting an end and being unable to act upon it has left me at an impasse.\n\nThroughout today, I've been fixated on the medication bottles around me despite knowing that their contents are insufficient for taking my life decisively. The notion of ingesting them in substantial doses merely as a means of being hospitalized hovers persistently in my thoughts. The urgency for serious assistance intensifies as pretending that everything is okay becomes unbearable.\n\nMy loved ones remain oblivious to the severity of my mental anguish as maintaining this façade grows more taxing each passing day.

I find myself consumed by a sense of wrongness within me, leading me to believe that I'm destined for a lifetime of solitude. What's even more distressing is that I feel guilty for feeling this way, especially when everything on the surface appears to be in order. I have a supportive family, a job that sustains me financially, yet I can't shake off this overwhelming desire to cease existing. My body image issues only compound these feelings; grappling with being overweight has left me perpetually self-conscious despite my efforts to shed the pounds. Progress in weight loss notwithstanding, my dissatisfaction with my physical appearance lingers on. The additional burden of gender dysphoria as a trans man further fuels this self-hatred. Despite undergoing two years of testosterone therapy, society still perceives me as female, and my own hesitation to correct this misconception eats away at me. The intersection of weight struggles and gender identity issues intensifies my self-loathing. Adding to these challenges is my sexual orientation - I am drawn to men but also identify as possibly asexual. This confluence makes me question if anyone would ever consider dating someone like me. The dissolution of my previous relationship with another trans man due to perceived inadequacies on my part lingers in my mind; feeling insufficiently masculine has left a lasting impact on my self-worth. Being non-binary and averse to sexual intimacy creates further barriers in forming romantic connections, leading me to believe that finding genuine love may be unattainable for someone like me. While suicide is not something I actively contemplate, I can't shake the thought that everyone around me would be better off without having to bear the weight of my struggles - whether it's listening to my grievances or navigating their way through having a transgender individual in their midst.

I resent how society has evolved into this state, where the confluence of social standards, aspects of a matriarchal society, and the prevalence of hookup culture like Tinder have made it nearly impossible for guys like me – who don't fit societal beauty standards – to find happiness and contentment in relationships. I'm filled with anger towards women for the way they've treated me – constant rejection or relegation to the friend zone. The weight of these experiences is suffocating me; I'm reaching my limit. My only solace seems to lie in numbing my senses with alcohol, as I see no way out of this cycle of despair. It feels like an inescapable reality – this relentless parade of rejections and empty reassurances like \"you're a great guy,\" \"you'll meet someone someday,\" or \"let's just be friends.\" Women appear to hold all the cards, and I can't bear the thought of continuing to exist in such a state of perpetual disappointment and heartache. The urge to end my own life is becoming overwhelming; it seems unlikely that things will ever improve or change for the better. The lost time, opportunities, and experiences weigh heavily on my\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}
{"prompt":"I am feeling overwhelmed with thoughts of wanting to end my life, but I am hesitating for some unknown reason. I just arrived home after work and the urge to harm myself is incredibly strong at the moment. In the past, I always imagined that before I were to take my own life, I would have my affairs in order - my apartment cleared out, job resigned from, and finances arranged for my family. However, none of that preparation has been done yet and yet the persistent idea of suicide lingers in my mind. There have been moments where I've placed a rope around my neck and mimicked hanging myself for a short while, although fear of failure and the potential consequences of surviving such an attempt - ending up in intensive care - have deterred me. Yet, here I am unable to shift my focus from these thoughts. It feels like this is what I deserve and waiting any longer seems unbearable, despite feeling frightened about failing. I carry the weight of being a burden on my loved ones, coworkers, even reaching out as a burden on strangers online now.

{"prompt":"- Feeling inclined to tackle one more issue in the world soon. And that issue is myself :)\"\n- Beginning to grasp the motivations behind heinous acts. Life seems like a cruel joke.\n- Struggling with pills and nausea. Every time I try to overdose, swallowing tablets becomes a major obstacle. Any tips on overcoming this challenge?\n- Rapid decline leading me to seriously consider suicide. After posting several times, I can clearly see the downward spiral I'm caught in. Suffering significant setbacks has left me feeling apathetic.\n- In short, my battle with depression and suicidal thoughts has been ongoing for a while now. The struggle intensified when I entered university – lacking friends, dealing with social anxiety, and battling depression turned me into a recluse. Venturing out solely for food, I started lagging behind academically and eventually flunked my second year. This marked a turning point where I turned to drugs in pursuit of that initial high from various substances, engaging in extensive experimentation except for opiates. Constantly altering drug combinations and using nitrous oxide\/balloons took a toll on my mental well-being. Subsequently, trying LSD three times further destabilized me mentally. Post-trips, there were some suicide attempts but nothing severe enough to warrant hospitalization until things took a darker turn at the beginning of this academic year.\n  \n  Returning to academics, my drug misuse led me to fail my second year for the second time. Although I barely passed the first semester, the online exams during COVID should have been foolproof with an open-book format – but my complacency resulted in zero preparation and resorting to cheating during exams aggravated my delusions further. As third year started with aspirations of change, old habits crept back in rapidly leading to another intense trip culminating in a genuine suicide attempt. Following this incident, I sought refuge at my parents' home briefly before facing exams independently only to fail once more. Shortly after this failure came an extended psychotic episode followed by another grave attempt and subsequent hospitalization before being discharged weeks later with strong recommendations from the university to take time off.\n  \n  Despite such advice, I persisted by completing doomed assignments and making yet another unsuccessful attempt which should have necessitated hospitalization again had it succeeded - while grappling with financial instability given student finance restrictions due to past failures compounded by job rejections resulting in dire financial straits ahead of returning to university.\n\n  My mental health deteriorated significantly over the subsequent summer recess leading me closer towards actions of finality. Dim prospects and an absence of financial backing exacerbated this decline pushing me closer towards irreversible decisions.\n  \n  Moreover, please refrain from advising seeking help as professional assistance has been exhausted through therapy sessions and trials of various antidepressants available in the UK – feeling adrift and resigned beyond remedy due to underlying issues extensively elaborated upon in prior posts.\"\n- Slipping back into emotional turmoil unsure how much more of it can be endured; contemplating approaches researched previously leaning towards implementation soon.\n\nEternal tranquility holds a strong allure.\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}

This individual not only continuously bullies my friend but has also made cruel and threatening remarks such as 'you should do the world a favor and end your life' and 'once I find you, it will be the end of you', in addition to repeatedly making derogatory comments about her weight. Furthermore, this bully has been creating manipulated images depicting my friend engaging in false conversations with her and others, presumably to tarnish my friend's reputation. Despite my friend's earnest requests for this woman to stop, the harassment persists unabated, now spanning over five days. The aggressor has resorted to creating a staggering total of 17 Instagram accounts solely for harassment purposes, along with using seven different phone numbers and two Facebook profiles. This relentless torment is taking a severe toll on my friend's mental well-being, leading to exhaustion and withdrawal from normal activities. Despite my efforts to encourage her to eat properly and engage in activities outside the house, she remains despondent. The advice from law enforcement not to engage at all has left her feeling helpless and unable to defend herself. It bewilders me how this bully can assume multiple roles such as a reverend, therapist, witch, light worker, healer, and personal trainer while exhibiting such abhorrent behavior.

{"prompt":"\"I haven't settled on a specific method to end my life yet, but I have been resorting to self-harm as a means to cope until I can eventually obtain my driver's license, allowing me to drive to a bridge or freeway overpass. I am considering acquiring a firearm in the near future. While these may seem like temporary solutions to multiple enduring challenges, the truth is that I find no joy or desire in continuing to live. My hope is for others to understand and respect my perspective.\n\nI lack any significant motivations that would compel me to persevere because not only do I feel inadequate in all pursuits, but I also possess no inclination to engage with the world around me. The things I am ignorant of hold no importance for me, and I lack curiosity or enthusiasm for exploration.\n\nIn addition to having no personal aspirations, I face social difficulties due to having Asperger's syndrome, rendering me socially inept and incapable of forming friendships—a circumstance unlikely to change throughout my lifetime. The prospect of forging meaningful connections or relationships seems daunting and unappealing. Thus, death appears more preferable than enduring such processes. No amount of advice or persuasion can alter my current mindset.\n\nIf the alternative is waiting years on end just for a casual acquaintance, then plummeting off a bridge seems like a more rational choice. In my view, individuals should have the autonomy to choose death when life holds no allure, and ultimately prolonging one’s existence only serves as a postponement of the inevitable realization that life's significance may well be an illusion.\" \n\n\"If you are contemplating reaching out to a suicide hotline, my advice would be against it based on my personal experiences. After numerous interactions with such services wherein I poured out my thoughts and feelings, the responses typically boiled down to generic encouragement or commendation for enduring prolonged suffering. It becomes evident that there are time constraints at play; after roughly thirty minutes, it becomes clear that they are eager to conclude the conversation. Expressing suicidal thoughts may prompt them to inquire about your specific plans regarding self-harm—an inquiry where caution is needed lest they involve authorities in your situation.\"\n\n\"I currently lack a solid plan for ending my life; could someone who understands lend an ear? My mind is overwhelmed with negative self-directed thoughts that seem incessant. The urge just to drive straight off a bridge looms large in my mind due mainly to not possessing a driver's license at this juncture.\"\n\n\"Once I obtain my driver's license, I intend on heading towards the tallest bridge in my state with the sole purpose of leaping off it—however morbid this plan may sound presently, it will likely materialize in months ahead once logistics are in place. Upon securing driving privileges soon, commandeering my parent's car for a final journey of about an hour towards that bridge will become feasible—the primary goal being swift relief from existence without concerns about pain or consequences.\n\nAll things considered though; this course of action must wait its turn until then. Life holds no appeal for me; therapy has proven futile in changing this viewpoint rooted deeply within me by now; hence there doesn't appear anything worth enduring for any further length of time since individual perspectives on life's purpose remain entirely subjective.\"\n\n\"I find myself entrenched deeply within an abyss of despair where gutting myself seems like a valid option every passing moment. Waking up each day feels like an endless series of regrets—I even orchestrate suicide scenarios in my dreams—the constant barrage of negative thoughts leaves me drained.\n\nTemporary distractions fail as sources of genuine joy—my disdain extends long-term—I despise existing both now and potentially forevermore; perhaps life simply does not align with who I am fundamentally.\" \n\n\"An urgent need for solace consumes me—can someone provide companionship? My emotions are entangled messily within me—a state where expressing these complexities verbally overwhelms me utterly—all aspects of myself seem distorted beyond recognition while lacking any significant connections or intimacy—a boiling pot ready to overflow coupled with disengagement from life entirely.\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

It seems like I just wasn't ready until now. As I write this, there's a loaded gun within reach, and the consequences of this post are uncertain.

It may sound unbelievable or irrational, but the weight of my life experiences has pushed me to this breaking point where death seems like the only escape from what feels like a cursed existence.\n\nAsking for help in this moment of crisis feels like my last resort - someone to talk to before I make a final decision.

It feels as though I can't even seek solace in discussing this because I anticipate someone subscribing to a victim-blaming perspective, likely inspired by Petersonian ideologies, telling me to simply work harder – despite already putting in maximum effort. My struggles stem from circumstances beyond my control. It's disheartening to see how life can be a heavy burden for many while others seem to live in blissful paradises. We find ourselves toiling tirelessly, yet our efforts seem insufficient due to insatiable greed among the elite billionaires. The living standards of a factory worker during the 50s-70s surpass those of many young professionals today. As a man, it's challenging for me to seek love without facing judgment for having basic standards – seeking nothing but fairness (and definitely not prioritizing looks). While women can evaluate and choose from suitors, men are left with the burden of initiating everything (because equality, right? \/s). I've endured bullying, mistreatment, and disrespect throughout my life. My parents refuse to accept me for who I am because I've strayed from the harsh beliefs ingrained in me since childhood, and without a supportive partner by my side, escaping this situation seems impossible. Moreover, grappling with issues deeply rooted in South Asian Muslim culture adds another layer of complexity (even when residing in Western societies). Despite my struggles and grievances, any attempt at voicing them is met with backlash or blame-shifting—an experience that only compounds the isolation felt.

This individual not only engages in relentless bullying but has also made troubling statements to my friend, such as suggesting she should end her life and threatening her with dire consequences when they cross paths. Additionally, the bully has repeatedly made derogatory remarks about my friend's physical appearance, going so far as to doctor images of her engaging in fabricated conversations to portray her negatively. Despite my friend's repeated requests for the harassment to cease, this woman persists, with the torment now spanning over five days. \n\nThe aggressor has resorted to creating a total of 17 Instagram accounts and using seven different phone numbers and two Facebook profiles solely for the purpose of harassing my friend. The continuous barrage is taking a significant toll on my friend's mental well-being; she is experiencing fatigue and has withdrawn from regular activities like eating and socializing. Despite efforts to support her, she remains unresponsive and distressed. The fact that authorities have advised against any direct confrontation has added to her sense of helplessness and frustration.\n\nIt is bewildering that this individual takes on various roles such as a reverend, therapist, witch, light worker, healer, and even a personal trainer while engaging in such vicious behavior. \n\nGiven these circumstances, I am considering publicly sharing the bully's phone number(s) and Instagram handle(s) to demand accountability for her actions.

Battling bipolar 1 for about 7 years now, the current situation with the pandemic and juggling two jobs has disrupted my usual coping mechanisms. Engaging in activities like painting, setting small achievable daily goals, and seeking human interaction were my go-to strategies, but they are currently out of reach. Consequently, I feel myself spiraling into a darker state. While I believe I am not an immediate danger to myself, I am aware of the fluctuating nature of such thoughts.\n\nDespite reaching out to friends and family for support, their responses have been disheartening. My sister labeled my venting as mere whining and urged me to focus on actionable solutions within my control rather than dwelling on the unchangeable. Meanwhile, my parents advised me to concentrate on the positive aspects. The delay in seeking medical attention is solely due to my insurance coverage beginning at the start of the month and my recent employment as a part-time educator. Abruptly leaving without explanation would create chaos among colleagues, whereas continuing under these circumstances would be challenging.\n\nThe upcoming wait until the 1st seems daunting in the realm of depression timeframes. Balancing financial concerns with the fear of returning home to a disarrayed situation weighs heavily on me.

The idea of being nothing but a burden has even led me contemplating pushing others away by behaving poorly so that they wouldn't miss me as much if I were gone.\n\nI'm constantly haunted by thoughts of ending my life but refrain from doing so out of concern for how it might devastate those around me.\nThe emotional connections binding me to this world weigh heavily on my shoulders; however, her presence in my life has kept me hanging on by a thread despite the mental warfare within causing immense anguish in my simple-minded state.\n\nAt times, ending it all seems like the ultimate solution where all remains silent upon the conclusion of my sorrowful tale—my conscience, thoughts, cares vanishing instantaneously—a prospect that does harbor some peace within it; yet deep down lies the knowledge that such an act doesn't conclude matters for others.\nI envision their anguish when they discover what has transpired—the psychological scars left behind—the lives shattered in its wake.\n\nThe intensity of my suicidal musings often obliges me to confront these nightmarish scenarios as a means of calming myself down.\nI bear such intense loathing towards both myself and this world; nonetheless, the fear of inflicting further pain onto others holds me back from giving in completely towards these impulses.'\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

The uncertainty of facing another economic downturn, job loss, and academic pressures amidst this crisis is weighing heavily on me.\n\nNavigating through the relentless challenges posed by COVID-19 is pushing me to my limits. The prospect of being unable to venture beyond my borders coupled with the virus' resilience despite vaccination efforts is disheartening. Contemplating whether I am deserving of enduring this suffocatingly oppressive and monotonous reality leads me to question if suicide could be a viable option now. Refusing to be trapped in a deteriorating world, I struggle to find purpose or motivation to persist. It feels like the virus has emerged victorious, prompting thoughts of why continuing on this path is worthwhile.\n\nThe perseverance and sacrifices made thus far feel futile as we teeter on the edge of despair. Surrendering seems like an increasingly tempting prospect as each day blurs into mere existence rather than living fully. Fatigue clouds my ability to function normally, disrupting even my sleep patterns. Perhaps it's time for me to acknowledge defeat and contemplate an end to this relentless struggle in search of peace.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

At 21 years old, having completed college in December, my upbringing by my eccentric hyper-evangelical homeschooling parents has left me with emotional scars. Despite working hard to earn my degree and escape my Appalachian hometown to pursue a career in software engineering, I found myself stuck in a nightmarish position at my first job due to a retroactive change in responsibilities.\n\nAlthough I managed to secure another job through my limited university connections, I am haunted by the fear that this may be my last opportunity. My rocky start at this new job — missing an email, procrastinating on HR paperwork, and being reassigned to a QA role despite wanting software development — has only heightened my anxiety. The blunt criticism from my boss earlier today about my performance so far has left me feeling unsteady and vulnerable.\n\nWhile I have since apologized and connected well with my new team, the sense of impending doom looms over me. The idea of potentially losing this job is terrifying since it would jeopardize my ability to afford rent. With a scarcity of friends in this new city and no romantic prospects for years, issues like appearance don't bother me much. However, the chaotic nature of my family upbringing continues to plague me, as I constantly feel like I missed out on a normal childhood and have been struggling all my life to break free from this suffocating cycle.\n\nDespite not actively considering self-harm, the thought of an escape lingers in the back of my mind as each attempt at progress seems to lead me into deeper despair.

Oddly, commercials trigger my sadness - the sounds, music, voices, and that final crescendo haunt me. Perhaps it stems from childhood, but I can't pinpoint the exact cause. Reconciling with a life not of my choosing is daunting. Tonight marks my first sober attempt at sleeping in three months – yet the urge to end it all grows stronger. My mind races ceaselessly. Sleep evades me; it's sheer misery. If a higher power exists, I have questions before facing damnation.\n\nThe casual query \"Are you okay?\" stings when met with disregard for my reply, turning the conversation inward without regard for my struggles – people can be callous. Is it strange that contemplations of ending my life bring relief and lessen the despair afterward? Would medication alleviate this depression?

Why do people value life so greatly? We toil for success and legacy, but why bother when everything vanishes upon death?\n\nAt 29, attempting a committed relationship for the first time proved disastrous: despite our shared aspirations and efforts to build a life together, she chose to explore other paths abruptly – leaving me shattered with her words of love and promises of a future echoing hollowly in my ears.

Conversing with supposed friends only yields clichéd recommendations of hotlines or therapy instead of genuine engagement – disclosure within family holds even less promise.\n\nThis disillusionment gnaws at me till death appears preferable to enduring further suffering without respite or compassion from those around me.

{"prompt":"I feel completely defeated. The thought of ending my life peacefully is all that consumes me. I'm a 23-year-old man who has never been in a relationship. Women have never viewed me as a potential partner or even as a suitable man. I always seem to fall short, lacking whatever mysterious quality they seek. It's all become too much to bear. The expectations imposed by our society, the dominance of women, and the rise of hook-up culture like Tinder have rendered it nearly impossible for men who are considered below average to find any semblance of happiness. I harbor deep resentment towards women for how they have treated me – constant rejection or relegation to the friend zone has been my reality. I've reached my breaking point. Existing in this world has become unbearable. Right now, all I can do is numb this pain with alcohol. This existence is unbearable. My interactions with women consist solely of rejection or offers of friendship, which only serve to further fuel my despair. It feels like women hold all the power and privilege in relationships and interactions, leaving me feeling utterly powerless and insignificant. The desire to end my life is overwhelming; I cannot see any possibility of improvement on the horizon. There is no way to compensate for the years lost, experiences foregone, and opportunities missed. I refuse to continue feeling like this worthless, broken soul any longer. My disdain for the world grows deeper with each passing day, a sentiment that developed only after realizing how much animosity was directed towards me from women – it's simply a cycle of mutual antipathy now.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

To make matters worse, my ex-partner betrayed me by cheating with him, and he opted for her over our friendship.

Now, it's difficult to bear the thought of them enjoying each other's company while I feel utterly isolated.\n\nI can't shake the feeling that my absence won't make a difference to anyone. It seems like I'm merely tolerated in the lives of those around me until a more suitable replacement comes along. The notion of brighter days ahead doesn't bring me much solace either. Yes, times may improve eventually during this rough patch, but these moments of contentment are fleeting and scarce in my life.

I believed I had moved past these thoughts of suicide, but now I feel completely stuck, like I'm between a rock and a hard place. My life has been filled with so much turmoil and there's this one particularly agonizing experience that overshadows everything else. It's too much for me to burden anyone with, except maybe my two long-time friends who have stuck by me for years. One of them even called for help the first time things got really bad. And then there's my mom - she's there for me too. \n\nThere's someone I deeply care about, but I'm almost certain they don't feel the same way about me anymore. The pain of having messed up a good thing with this person hurts more than anything else I've ever been through.

This person knew me inside out, beyond anyone else, and it's hard to imagine opening up to another person again.\n\nI was managing okay for a while, but my living situation is tough and the weight of all my past trauma is crushing me.

{"prompt":"Reasons why I feel compelled to bring it all to an end are overwhelming me. The desire to simply shut down takes over, with my mind consumed by thoughts of ending everything. The challenges of living with epilepsy, the constant headaches, paranoia, overthinking, and the sleepless nights with body dysmorphia, anorexia, and a melancholic state of mind weigh heavily on me. The reckless behavior compounded by brain fog and the inability to focus on basic daily tasks add to the burden. Reflecting on my childhood reveals a deviation from the norm early on. Dealing with selective mutism and withdrawing into my own thoughts was a common theme. Inner monologues, imaginative narratives, and a preference for staying indoors reading my grandfather's books rather than socializing outdoors defined me. School felt restrictive and uninspiring, leading me to be a wallflower despite being recognized for my abilities by others. The lack of inclusion mentallay in that environment left me feeling isolated.\n\nMy family's conservatism contrasted starkly with my need for greater openness and understanding, which I found in my grandfather. Neglect at home, overshadowed by more extroverted siblings and overlooked due to seeming \"normal,\" fostered a sense of abandonment from an early age, deepening feelings of loneliness. With limited guidance and the absence of nurturing environments at home or school to develop social skills, I became accustomed to silence for nearly 15 years.\n\nTraumatic events like a car crash left untreated after being taken directly to school instead of receiving medical care further exacerbated my sense of abandonment and trauma. Physical and mental bullying in a hostile social environment without support drove me deeper into despair. Battling negative voices culminated in an epilepsy diagnosis due to extreme stress levels.The loss of my grandfather intensified feelings of abandonment already festering within me.\n\nSeeing dreams crushed - like missing out on studying engineering in Malaysia on a scholarship due his prejudice against girls living alone - delivered another blow that I struggled to recover from.Unfortunately resulting in self-sabotage using painkillers prescribed for depression led to addiction further damaging me physically while emotionally failing to cope with it all.\n\nThese continuous breakdowns have left me feeling like life is inherently unfair - not just sad but maddeningly unjust where even seeking help through medication has backfired leading only further downhill into self-destructive patterns.I am left feeling utterly alone having lost friends which pains deeply highlighting my shortcomings.My inability to cope has brought undeniable grief making way for dark thoughts about how life seems like a relentless cycle of pain.\n\nFeeling like an unworthy failure unable to appreciate any blessings has become a harsh reality.Every gift sabotaged only reinforces this toxic voice within.This distorted view leads down a path contemplating if it truly is easier just 'to end it all.'\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

While I've made efforts to improve my relationship with my sister, I still find myself in a state of anguish. It seems likely that the abuse I endured has led to some form of PTSD and general anxiety disorder. The physical health issues I've been experiencing are believed by my therapist to be a result of my anxiety. The overwhelming sense of loneliness and neglect weighs heavily on me, making me believe that I am unworthy of love and simply a burden on this world. Tears stream down my face as I write this, yearning for companionship, not necessarily romantic, but just someone to share life with and grow old alongside. Even the thought of losing such a person after experiencing love would be preferable to enduring this solitude where people either abandon me upon detecting my vulnerabilities or choose to exploit them, forcing me to sever ties with them. Why do I feel so abandoned? While turning to my faith brings some solace, it is preceded by immense pain. Even during moments of relaxation like playing a game or reading a book, my body is tense with discomfort. It seems that nobody is willing to lend an ear without expecting payment in return. Fortunately, I have found solace in a compassionate therapist who listens without judgment, but the realization that our connection is only upheld through financial transactions deepens my sense of isolation. Despite her advice to focus on the present moment, when I do so, I sink into a pit of despair. Ever since being subjected to my father's abuse, I have carried the weight of feeling like an outcast and fear that this status will remain unchanged indefinitely. My heart yearns for love and affection—longing for embraces, reassurances of worthiness, validation of intelligence, and comforting words about brighter days ahead. At present, all that holds me together are fragile threads as I search for moments of joy in the world akin to those from my youth. However, each time I confront my inner demons; they intensify their grip on me relentlessly. The thought lingers that the world would continue spinning unaffected if I were no longer in it—I am progressively fading from the memories of those who once knew me well.

I informed him abruptly that I needed to step back until after Valentine's Day without giving any explanation. The truth is, Valentine's Day advertisements in my country intensify my emotional pain, making it unbearable to stay connected with him. It was thoughtless of me not to clarify my actions, especially knowing his deep-seated fear of abandonment. I fear he now sees me as someone who has abandoned him entirely. I am consumed by guilt and self-loathing, wondering what steps to take next. I feel like utter trash for hurting my friend due to my own overwhelming emotions.

{"prompt":"I am 26 years old and recently experienced the devastation of losing my best friend of 15 years. He meant everything to me, the only person I truly believed cared about me. To make matters worse, my ex-partner betrayed me by cheating with him and he chose her over me. She was my first serious girlfriend, and I invested a lot emotionally in our relationship. It's heartbreaking to think about them now having a great time together while I am left feeling completely isolated.\n\nI cannot shake the feeling that no one will notice or care if I were to disappear. It seems like I have no meaningful impact on the lives of those around me; they simply tolerate my presence until someone new comes along.\n\nI find it hard to believe that good times are worth waiting for. Although I understand that things may improve somewhat in the future as I navigate through this rough period, moments of genuine happiness are so scarce and fleeting in my life. The constant cycle of pain overshadowing any joy makes me question if enduring a life where 90% is suffering and only 10% is happiness is truly worthwhile.

{"prompt":"Feeling completely exhausted by everything. The challenges seem never-ending. Lately, thoughts of suicide provide me with the only solace. Dealing with severe depression presently, it's been a lifelong battle. Regret and self-loathing consume me daily for the mistakes and decisions of my past, causing irreparable damage to my relationships. Reflecting on my behavior fills me with overwhelming shame and guilt. Losing numerous friends in the past year has exacerbated my sense of isolation, particularly after graduating from college without a job, amplifying disconnection from others. The weight of shame and depression compounds daily struggles, leading me to withdraw even further into solitude. Each day feels like an arduous fight for survival as I confine myself to my room, neglecting basic needs like eating properly or maintaining a regular sleep routine; even simple tasks like leaving bed feel insurmountable. As a Black trans man, I am fortunate to have a supportive therapist who shares my background, yet doubts persist about the possibility of finding genuine help. Despite confiding in her about various issues, admitting these suicidal thoughts feels too embarrassing and risky since I fear mandatory reporting might involve law enforcement visiting my home, worsening an already bleak situation. Most days end with the wish that this pain will cease by no longer existing, as envisioning any future or attempting self-compassion appears futile. Viewing myself as burdensome leads to the conviction that perhaps others and the world would be better off without me around.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

Yet, the bleak reality makes it hard for me to envision any positive change at all. \n\nStrangely, I find myself hesitant about getting better. Even though I desire improvement, staying in this familiar and secure place seems easier. This state has been my companion for so long that picturing a life without it seems impossible. The constant barrage of negative thoughts consumes me, and I regret not choosing a different path earlier in life as I despise my current situation.\n\nI yearn to open up to my friends about how I feel, but the knowledge that some of them are battling similar demons holds me back. There's almost a craving for attention from anyone just so someone can understand the depth of my despair. Despite being diagnosed with depression and seeking therapy, I am contemplating discontinuing my sessions. Although it may not be wise, these sessions have yielded no tangible results after attending multiple appointments with minimal progress.

I'm reaching a breaking point where continuing feels like an unbearable journey towards a purposeless void filled with agony. My reliance on substances stems from a deep-seated need for affection. Can anyone else relate to this sentiment? Despite being married, I often feel isolated within the confines of my mind. It pains me that my partner doesn't reciprocate the care and concern that I wholeheartedly offer them. Feeling abandoned by them during my lowest mental health struggles was incredibly damaging. Entering a relationship with someone who didn't prioritize our bond when I needed their support shattered me beyond repair. The normalization of polyamory and open relationships only adds to my distress. Not only do I feel disconnected from those around me, including friends and family, but also from my partner who should be my source of solace in times of pain and confusion.\n\nThe weight of everything - from the lingering effects of the pandemic to personal hardships - has left me disillusioned with life.

He exudes kindness, intelligence, and remarkable wit; characteristics that make him an exceptional 14-year-old. However, his hardships have left a profound impact on his life. Despite his gradual recovery, it is evident that he has undergone undeserved suffering and deserves a brighter outlook.

During my recent visit to the dentist, I was informed that receiving a night guard is the only solution available. The realization that I have allowed my teeth to deteriorate to such an extent fills me with deep shame. This neglect primarily stems from my declining oral hygiene habits due to a period of worsened depression when I stopped prioritizing self-care.

My isolation has led me to distance myself from friends, and I rarely venture outside anymore. All I yearn for is a job that would grant me a semblance of normalcy in society. The desire for purpose gnaws at me - to interact with new faces, explore new places. The monotony of waiting for change while being confined indoors has become unbearable. It's not that I despise life itself, but rather the current state of my existence feels intolerable. I fear the unchanging pattern that seems to have gripped my life; while others around me are making strides in their careers, relationships, and living situations, I remain stagnant in the same house from my childhood.

{"prompt":"Why do I even exist? Throughout my entire existence, all I seem to do is disappoint. Whether it's as a son, a brother, a boyfriend, a father, an employee, a friend, a grandson, or a nephew - the weight of my failures is crushing. In just the past 4 days, I've attempted to end it all twice, yet here I still am. I can't even bring myself to look my girlfriend in the eyes or ask for help. The reflection in the mirror is unfamiliar to me because deep down inside, I loathe the person staring back at me. Behind the superficial observations of my clothes and haircut lies a self that I can no longer tolerate facing. I've constructed this facade of strength for so long that admitting I'm not that person has driven me to isolate myself from everyone else.\n\nI've been absent from work for 4 days now, unable to even get out of bed. My girlfriend probably thinks I despise her because articulating my desire to not exist seems impossible. As for my son, whom I lost custody of last year - he must be wondering why his dad has disappeared from his life. Yet deep down, I doubt my ability to positively contribute to his upbringing. My workplace must be puzzled by my sudden vanishing act with no explanation; they likely have given up on me just as I had given up on myself long ago.\n\nTo numb the pain and self-loathing, I resort to drinking, smoking, and seeking solace in substances - if only for brief respites from self-hatred. However, during moments of clarity amidst this haze, the disdain for myself intensifies further. Yesterday's desperate act of consuming two dozen muscle relaxers and four dozen painkillers was enveloped in a hope that morning would never come for me - yet here we are: another day where failure embraces me. Sadly though strangely comforting was realizing that with my departure would mean no more opportunities for letting others down again.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}

Having to go back to their house until January 19th feels like a prison sentence. Despite my attempts to help myself, I feel helpless and trapped by both my emotions and the people who have hurt me.\n\nOn top of this, there are other layers of trauma inflicted by my family's mistreatment. Their disregard for my well-being forced me into financial strain while trying to cover basic needs like dental care. Sacrificing my mental health and career prospects for the sake of a sibling who was prioritized over me only adds to my sense of being unheard and undervalued. Even when faced with serious challenges such as surviving meningitis and losing part of my hearing, my expressions of trauma are belittled or dismissed by those closest to me.\n\nFurthermore, the toxic dynamics at home are compounded by external influences like the radical leftist culture at school, which often resorts to blanket accusations and guilt-tripping based on identity politics. Being moderate left in such an environment leaves me feeling isolated due to the generational gap that prevents understanding between us.\n\nThe compounded effects of familial injustice, financial struggles, emotional neglect, dismissive attitudes towards personal trauma, and societal pressures have left me feeling utterly defeated with no respite in sight.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

In summary: the physical toll from working in retail is draining me, yet I can't afford to stop because my family would disapprove. My life feels stagnant, and all I crave when I return home is rest. I'm earning very little, and what's left is further reduced by my mother. The idea of taking my own life has crossed my mind lately, considering it's not much different from what I'm enduring currently. While I dislike playing the victim card, it seems as though my circumstances have been set up for failure or at least to make success incredibly challenging. I also believe that my family shares some responsibility in this situation. Growing up in a household with only women has stunted me, and now I'm stuck in a job that brings me no joy with a commute that's deteriorating my health. The physical strain of work coupled with the exhausting journey back home leaves me with minimal recovery time for my body. The pay isn't commensurate with the toll it takes, and a significant portion goes towards bills each month. Saving money is arduous, especially when trying to maintain a healthier diet than what's customary at home. By the time the next paycheck arrives, my bank account is nearly empty - it's disheartening. And though I acknowledge my part in this predicament, it feels like I'm carrying responsibilities meant for their future partners instead of progressing towards building a family of my own. Surprisingly, there's no expectation for me to move out! It's disheartening being 27 years old soon to turn 28 in December and feeling stuck in place. Constantly drained physically due to work demands, exercise has taken a backseat lately. If I contemplate leaving this job, my mother will likely view it as giving up without seeking alternative employment opportunities - where she got this notion from baffles me. However, enough is enough; nothing seems to be changing positively around me, hindering any potential progress onward. Perhaps it's better to leave before things deteriorate further because if everything remains unchanged, what motivation do I have to get out of bed each morning?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

{"prompt":"1. I am currently without a plan for ending my life, resorting to self-harm as a temporary measure while I wait to obtain my driver's license. Once I have the means, I intend to visit a bridge or freeway overpass as part of what I see as a short-term solution to ongoing issues that seem insurmountable. Living is not something I find pleasure in or actively desire. It would be appreciated if others could acknowledge and respect my perspective.\n\nIn addition, there is nothing that captures my interest enough to keep me engaged; my lack of skill at anything and disinterest in worldly pursuits contribute to a sense of apathy. The social challenges associated with Asperger's syndrome have left me isolated without close friendships or romantic relationships, leading me to the conclusion that ending my life may be preferable to enduring further loneliness. Regardless of what anyone may say, my conviction remains unshaken.\n\nIf the prospect of waiting years for even a casual acquaintance is the only outlook, then taking a leap off a bridge seems more appealing. I believe in the right to choose one's own end when life holds no allure, and it is evident that any perceived meaning in existence is but an illusion that others may not yet recognize.\n\n2. My experience with reaching out to suicide hotlines has left me disillusioned and dissatisfied. Despite multiple attempts at contacting them for support, their approach seems limited to providing an outlet for venting before offering generic affirmations about strength or redirection towards personal interests. The unmistakable time constraints become apparent after approximately thirty minutes, signaling a desire to conclude the conversation swiftly. Expressing suicidal thoughts necessitates caution in order to avoid being involuntarily sent for psychiatric evaluation by using certain phrases as triggers for intervention.\n\n3. Without a concrete plan for self-harm, could someone who comprehends reach out via text? My mind is consumed by negative thoughts largely focused on myself and it would be beneficial to have an alternative perspective. While the urge to drive to a bridge and jump off exists due to lacking a driver's license, I must bide my time until circumstances align.\n\n4. Upon securing my driver's license, I am determined to travel towards the highest bridge in this state with the intention of ending my life by jumping off it. Though immediate means are unavailable presently, they will be accessible in the near future once I acquire my license and take possession of my parent's vehicle for the purpose of reaching this location about an hour away. The manner of death does not provoke fear as much as it represents completion of an objective without delay.\n\nWhile this inevitability looms, existing holds no appeal for me; neither therapy nor persuasive arguments can alter this perception from which I infer that life lacks purpose on a personal level grounded in subjective interpretations.\n\n5. My current state plunges me into profound darkness where self-harm feels like the only respite from relentless despair pervading each passing day. Regret accompanies each morning awakening while even in dreams, thoughts stray towards self-inflicted demise. Temporary joys hold no sway over long-term negativity as existence itself becomes burdensome — perhaps indicating that life isn't suited for someone like me.\n\n6.I urgently seek solace through conversation with someone willing to listen and engage with me during these tumultuous times when articulating feelings proves challenging due to being overwhelmed by emotional turmoil amidst an absence of friendships or intimate connections. This internal turmoil simmers incessantly akin to boiling tea while feeling detached from life altogether contributes further unease and detachment from reality.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

In essence, working in retail has taken a toll on my physical well-being, yet leaving is not permissible as it would cause a commotion within my family. Life seems stagnant with no excitement, and all I yearn for upon returning home is to rest. The minimal pay I receive is further diminished by my mother taking a significant portion. The idea of ending it all has crossed my mind, considering it doesn't seem much different from my current struggling existence. I try not to play the victim card, but deep down, I feel like the path set for me was destined for failure or was intentionally made more challenging to achieve success. My family dynamics also contribute to this sense of hopelessness. Being raised by a single mother in a predominantly female household has hindered my personal growth. Now, stuck in a job that brings me no joy and relying on transportation that harms my body further exacerbates the situation. The physical toll of work leaves me with barely any time to recuperate properly. The meager salary hardly seems worth it when a substantial part goes towards expenses. Saving becomes arduous as I must prioritize buying nutritious food due to the unhealthy eating habits at home. By the time the next paycheck rolls in, my bank account is practically depleted - a disheartening cycle. Taking accountability for my circumstances doesn't change the fact that it feels like I'm shouldering the responsibilities typically assigned to spouses or partners rather than pursuing building a family of my own as intended by societal norms at this stage of my life - being 27 years old and approaching 28 in December! Feeling stuck in this rut takes a toll on both my physical and mental well-being; therefore, engaging in intense workouts has become increasingly challenging for me.

Due to COVID restrictions, I had been solely responsible for looking after their new kittens for a few weeks before reuniting with my family (within our support bubble). Naturally, after caring for them alone for almost three weeks, they've grown quite attached to me. I had planned to spend a week at home (even took time off work) hoping my parents would want to spend quality time with me despite the kittens being around. Unfortunately, they haven't shown any interest in bonding with the kittens and then become envious and irritated when the kittens seek my company.

Coupled with a migraine, all these emotions are magnified further still. Undoubtedly, there are underlying issues beyond this current incident, but why is this particular event pushing me beyond my limits? It feels nonsensical. It seems wrong for me to react this way or be angered by something as seemingly trivial as how they handle the kittens' comfort. I am furious that they believe confining them is beneficial at all.

My father was absent from my life since I was around 11-12; my mom succumbed to sleep apnea and an enlarged heart, while my dad perished in a car accident. They were estranged, and I deeply miss them both. Fast forward a bit. The first time I attempted suicide, I used a phone charger because I couldn't find rope, feeling utterly despairing. Following that incident, I made a \"pledge\" to enlist in the military and meet my end in combat, but upon moving in with my aunt and uncle, that mindset shifted swiftly. Things appeared to be looking up – excelling academically, garnering support from friends and family who lauded me as the strongest person they knew with unwavering backing. However, it dawned on me that all my achievements stemmed from leaning on the love and support of others. My high school graduation and college acceptance were solely due to their relentless encouragement; unfortunately, once college commenced, everything nosedived at lightning speed. My academic performance plummeted drastically, marking the end of my dependency on others. My drive faltered, jeopardizing my job security. Despite several suicide attempts, the thought of the anguish it would inflict upon my family always resurfaces at the last moment. Each day becomes more arduous; recently landing in jail for two nights due to felony possession of shrooms (a severe offense in my location), salvaging the situation hinges on improving grades – an insurmountable task given the backlog of missed classes and assignments. Expressing emotions is not something I do easily; every inquiry about my well-being or emotional state is met with falsehoods. The exhaustion is overwhelming; death appears increasingly appealing as a means to bring my fractured family together since all I seem to have caused are troubles that drove everyone away. Since relocating to campus, life has improved for my aunt and uncle's family now that I am no longer there. Lately...\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}

I've been labeled as pessimistic simply because my own battles with mental disorders and suicidal thoughts have led me to a deeper understanding of the world and potential solutions. It's disheartening to receive criticism for being truthful and practical. If someone dealing with mental health challenges or contemplating suicide feels compelled to start a family, I won't pass judgment – they could very well excel as a parent.

{"prompt":"I am fourteen years old, and my sole reason for staying alive is my younger brother. Over the last two years, ever since I returned to my native country of Romania, I have been overwhelmed by stress, primarily stemming from school. Back in 2019, I found myself lacking friends and frequently cried myself to sleep each week. Even activities that once brought me joy became dull, and the thought of ending my own life crossed my mind multiple times. However, the love I have for my little brother has always prevented me from acting on those thoughts. Amidst the pandemic, things started looking up a bit - although anxiety still lingered, I found solace in a friend who lent a supportive ear and made a significant difference in my life. The reason for expressing all this now is because things have taken a turn for the worse lately. I am consumed by stress and anxiety, lacking motivation for anything. Additionally, last year I came to terms with being atheist and bisexual; however, my deeply religious family and friends present a challenge. I recently confided in my only friend about this aspect of myself, only to find him growing distant thereafter - he was the one person with whom I felt secure enough to share and converse regularly. Keeping all these emotions bottled up inside me feels suffocating, especially considering that if I were to open up to someone close to me, they might dismiss it as 'just a phase' or belittle my struggles due to my age. Coping with all this seems increasingly difficult as schools prepare to reopen knowing that teachers will likely be unforgiving due to the challenges posed by online learning.

The thought of recovery is daunting; as much as I desire it, the familiarity and perceived safety of my current state make change seem alien and unsettling. This existence, rife with incessant thoughts, has become my norm for so long that picturing a life without them eludes me. Regret consumes me over not having chosen a different path earlier on – I despise where I find myself now. Despite yearning to confide in my friends about these overwhelming emotions, the knowledge that some of them battle similar demons holds me back. There's a part of me that craves attention, simply so someone can understand the depth of my despair. While I've been diagnosed with depression and have embarked on therapy sessions, the lack of progress prompts me to contemplate giving up on treatment.

The prospect of ending my life looms large in my mind, driven by a profound sense of despair that overshadows any glimmer of happiness that may come my way.\n\nThe belief that a higher power exists feels distant and cynical; each time joy or pleasure seems within reach, it is swiftly replaced by overwhelming waves of darkness and desolation.

The desire to end it all gnaws at me constantly, fueled by a determination to spare my loved ones the financial burden of a funeral they can ill afford.\n\nIn this deep pit of hopelessness, reaching out for assistance feels futile; every avenue explored seems to lead back to this abyss of anguish.

The constant noise of yelling and fighting, the heart-wrenching sounds of dogs in pain as they are mistreated, it all weighs heavily on me. I feel trapped in a facade of safety that's anything but real; reality itself has lost its meaning to me. This perpetual sense of unreality has left me unable to find a release, unable to mend the broken pieces within myself or around me.\n\nWhy do these thoughts plague my mind? Why do I find myself fantasizing about causing harm? Why do I crave the dreadful sensation of wielding a sharp blade? Why does the idea of enduring unspeakable things hold a strange allure for me? It's unsettling to even consider that perhaps some form of sexual assault has touched my life before, buried so deep in my subconscious that I cannot recall it now. It's not for attention that these thoughts linger; rather, it's a distorted desire to validate my existence.\n\nI diminish my own trauma, believing it insufficient to warrant attention or care. If it were truly severe, wouldn't I exhibit signs like Dissociative Identity Disorder or Bipolar disorder? Yet still, there is this perverse fascination with the notion of suffering from a grave illness like Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) or Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS). The craving for attention grapples with a twisted form of self-denial: did any of these disturbing experiences actually occur? If they did transpire, why does my memory fail me so profoundly?\n\nThe void within seems boundless; memories evade recollection as if swept away by an unseen tide. How did circumstances lead us here? What twisted fate has governed this despairing path? Why am I burdened with these inclinations? Unwillingly drawn into a deluded narrative by my own mind, I am ensnared in self-destructive tendencies.

Fleeting moments of respite punctuate the perpetual anguish before sickness grips me once more. A relentless cycle plays out - hoping against hope only to be dragged back into desolation again and again. Ultimately, like a terminal act of mercy on an afflicted animal, there may come a time when even I must cease prolonging this ordeal.\n\nThe thought lingers uncomfortably: why does it seem more heartrending when an animal is put down by its own volition than when humans make such decisions?

Despite my attempts to move away, he persistently invaded my personal space. Due to being reserved and socially anxious, I didn't confront him.

The insidious nature of depression silently infiltrates one's being, persisting without respite. One may even question the possibility of finding a lasting remedy for this relentless condition.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" in"}
{"prompt":"I feel like there is no reason for me to continue living. Why drag on for another ten years? Or even for another week? It seems pointless when I cannot find any joy in it. The only motivation to stay alive comes from the expectations of others, which seems absurd - living not for myself but for someone else is like a twisted joke. While there's a possibility that life could improve, I can't predict the future. Although I can envision various scenarios, none of them feel right. But who knows, maybe against all odds, something good might happen, albeit very rarely. However, what seems more probable is life taking a turn for the worse. What if I fail college and squander thousands of dollars? What if my unhealthy habits deteriorate my physical well-being? What if someone says something innocuous that triggers an intense bout of overthinking, leading me to believe they despise me, despite knowing deep down that it's not true – just like what happened last night? The downward spiral appears inevitable, and if I surrender now, at least I wouldn't have wasted energy in trying to hang on.\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

Despite trying various treatments and therapies, nothing seems to have significantly improved his mental health. Lately, he has confided in me that he has reached a point where he is contemplating ending his life in the near future.\n\nI am at a loss about how to best support him during this tumultuous time. I am willing to listen, offer advice, and engage in activities that may help distract him or assist in developing coping strategies. Drawing from my own experiences with suicidal thoughts, I understand the emotional turmoil that accompanies such dark moments.\n\nHowever, I am hesitant to involve his partner due to concerns about their potentially overwhelming reaction and its impact on my friend's already fragile state of mind. Moreover, he had a distressing experience during a brief stay in a psychiatric facility previously, which makes me reluctant to consider it as an immediate solution.\n\nHe seems to be waiting for some sort of divine intervention or clear purpose to guide him through this darkness, but I believe that sometimes we have to actively seek out our own reasons for living.

My diabetes diagnosis now means I have access to insulin pens, which did provide a momentary relief from the shock I experienced earlier. However, the constant hassle of managing the pens is becoming overwhelming. The doctor mentioned the possibility of switching to an insulin pump if my condition deteriorates rapidly.

The sound of the dogs whimpering in pain after being abused is unbearable. I'm tired of living in a false sense of security. Reality seems elusive to me now, perhaps it always has been. I can't find a way to let go of this anguish. I can't figure out how to mend things, not for others nor for myself. Why do these thoughts of causing harm persist? Why do I crave the twisted excitement of causing harm to someone? Why do I wish for terrible things to befall me just to feel some relief? Nobody desires to experience sexual assault, so why does the idea entice me? Maybe it's because it feels vaguely familiar, like a memory buried deep within that I can't access. It's not for attention that I seek these dark thoughts, but rather a sense of validation that seems out of reach. My suffering doesn't measure up, does it? If it did, maybe then I would have a severe condition like Dissociative Identity Disorder or Bipolar disorder. But even being afflicted with a serious illness isn't anyone's aspiration, yet strangely, I almost yearn for it—perhaps something debilitating like POTS or EDS. Is this longing for attention what drives these unsettling desires? Did any of these experiences actually occur, and if they did, why are they shrouded in oblivion? The absence of recollection is disorienting. It feels as though all memories have slipped through my grasp, leaving me adrift in confusion and despair. How did things spiral to this point?

My quality of life is abysmal due to circumstances beyond my control. For many, life seems nothing more than an endless string of hardships while others appear to bask in blissful circumstances. The current societal dynamics dictate that we toil ceaselessly for diminishing returns just to satiate the insatiable avarice of billionaires. Back in the 50s-70s, even a factory worker enjoyed a higher standard of living than what a young professional experiences now. As a man, finding love proves to be an arduous task and setting personal standards is often met with criticism (I simply seek fairness in relationships, not superficial beauty standards); my expectations aren't unreasonable. Meanwhile, women seem to effortlessly attract suitors while men are left shouldering the majority of the effort (ah, the irony of equality \/s). Enduring a lifetime of bullying, harassment, and mistreatment has left me feeling dejected. My parents refuse to accept me for who I am due to my divergence from the rigid faith I was raised in, and lacking a supportive partner only exacerbates my sense of entrapment.

Despite attempting therapy, I find myself unable to articulate the depth of my anguish to the therapist due to the overwhelming emotional burden it carries. Self-loathing consumes me as I believe that my actions only serve to worsen the lives of those around me. The weight of it all has brought me to the brink – I feel incapable of enduring any longer. Fear holds me back from taking drastic measures for fear of failure and the potential consequences such as severe injury or confinement in a mental institution, both of which would only compound my suffering. While contemplating suicide, I am conflicted by the knowledge that though my absence may bring sadness, it could also offer respite from the responsibility others have shouldered in caring for me. In this state of despair, I convince myself that I do not belong in this world; where there is no solace to be found and every step forward results in more missteps and destruction.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

It's tough when MY parents are not only abusive but also have enough financial control to prevent me from leaving. I lack money, a driver's license, friends – it seems like failure is all that's left for me, so why not just end it? I've become the laughing stock of school, even during online classes on Zoom where I was mocked for stuttering throughout a presentation by everyone – including my crush, the closest thing I have to a friend in that class, and even my teacher. Despising them all – my parents included – makes me wish to vanish without needing anyone's sympathy or validation of their impact on me. Escaping to some distant college with a full scholarship and starting anew without ever crossing paths with anyone from my current life seems like the only thing holding me back from complete despair.

Comparing the standard of living between a factory worker in the past and a young professional today, it's evident how things have worsened over time.\n\nNavigating relationships as a man feels particularly challenging, especially when trying to establish reasonable expectations without being attacked for having standards – and by standards, I mean fair treatment rather than superficial qualities like appearance. The imbalance where women can sit back and choose while men are expected to do all the pursuing undermines the notion of equality.\n\nThroughout my life, I've faced bullying, harassment, and consistent mistreatment. My parents struggle to accept me because I don't adhere to the strict religious beliefs I was raised with, leaving me feeling trapped without the support of a loving partner. Coming from a South Asian Muslim background adds another layer of complexity and hardship.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, even though I voice my struggles, I'm met with backlash and victim-blaming instead of understanding or compassion – it feels like there are people out there just waiting to kick me while I'm already down.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" in"}

It's bizarre how even in that moment, her words played on repeat, almost mocking the severity of my actions. Reflecting back, I can't shake off this unsettling feeling that my suicide attempt was almost like a dramatic performance, leaving me puzzled as to why I perceive it that way.

{"prompt":"Sometimes I find myself wishing for an end to all this and harboring resentment towards my parents. It's confusing because objectively my life seems alright - I stay with my parents who provide for me financially. We live in a comfortable home and I have the things I desire. I adore my two dogs and the thought of leaving them behind fills me with dread. In college, although my performance isn't stellar, I'm on track to graduate in two years, after which I can secure a job and move out. There are moments when I can't stand my parents, but deep down, I love them immensely. In fact, the mere idea of them not being close by troubles me. However, their outbursts over trivial matters make me want to disappear when they raise their voices unpredictably. Ironically, they don't reprimand me much for academic struggles but can explode over something as minor as a strand of hair on the floor; sometimes I wonder if my mom might have OCD. While their love for me is undeniable, their relentless yelling seems uncontrollable - maybe if I were flawless, they would ease up a bit. Perhaps if I consistently scored top grades and maintained impeccable cleanliness in my room while contributing more around the house, their shouting might lessen. But summoning the willpower to achieve that seems like an insurmountable challenge; some days even getting out of bed feels like an impossible task. The weight of disappointment clings to me; undoubtedly, there are areas where I fall short and need to exercise greater self-discipline. Battling anxiety and depression is an ongoing struggle; although medication like Adderall and Paxil brings relief by enhancing my sociability and aiding in completing school tasks, moments resurface where everything feels bleak again despite making progress.

While I can't envision how things could improve and every scenario seems bleak, there's still that rare chance, one in a billion perhaps, that things could change. But you know what's more probable than that? Life taking a turn for the worse. What if I flunk out of college and waste all that money? What if my unhealthy habits catch up to me and ruin my physical well-being? What if someone says something innocuous and I blow it out of proportion, convincing myself they despise me, even though deep down, I know that's not true - like what happened last night when I ended up in tears over a simple comment?

The cycle seems to ebb and flow – moments of improvement followed by downturns, and then a flicker of hope before descending once more, repeating endlessly. The constant act of bargaining with myself to stay alive is draining. The effort to heal feels futile when it's driven solely by the need to spare my loved ones from anguish caused by my absence. Yet, truth be told, there are instances when I find it hard to muster any concern for them anymore. Perhaps that detachment is what they referred to as 'indifference towards others' during my PTSD diagnosis (which I'm still coming to terms with; it never seemed severe enough in my eyes, but apparently not everyone lives in a perpetual state of fear, agony, and detachment).

Amidst these struggles, I have also had to contend with the pressures of school which have proven to be the most burdensome. Despite my best efforts, trying to keep up with academic responsibilities after such traumatic experiences has been excruciatingly difficult.\n\nThe hope of reaching Friday was what kept me going through these trying days, as I longed for the respite promised by the end of the week—a chance to receive birthday gifts withheld from me and engage in activities that bring me joy. However, the extension of my punishment serves as a stark reminder that my efforts are continually deemed inadequate and unappreciated. Feeling like a disappointment and being denied even small moments of happiness has reinforced the belief that my existence is unworthy of joy but instead deserving of endless suffering.\n\nThe weight of expectations placed on academic performance over mental health has only added to my despair. The constant reminders of being on punishment for poor grades rather than receiving support or addressing underlying issues have left me feeling abandoned and misunderstood. Each day feels like an unbearable struggle, with no light at the end of the tunnel, only darkness and unending pain.\n\nDespite my attempts to alleviate my distress and seek solace in activities like playing games or learning music, I have faced criticism and further punishment instead of understanding and compassion. The lack of privacy regarding personal struggles and a sense of being constantly scrutinized intensify feelings of worthlessness and isolation.\n\nAs I navigate through each day with a heavy heart and dwindling hope, thoughts of self-harm persist as a means to escape this unrelenting cycle of suffering. The absence of viable support systems or access to necessary resources exacerbates the sense of helplessness that pervades every aspect of my existence.

The pain of failure stings even more each time I dare to hope for something good.

The idea that those who've hurt me might escape consequences adds another layer of bitterness.\n\nThe pain goes deeper when it comes to relationships.

It becomes increasingly challenging for those around you to grasp the depth of your emotional turmoil.

{"prompt":"I am exhausted from constantly feeling overwhelmingly sad and anxious, with happiness barely making up 1% of my emotional spectrum. The constant battle with depression and anxiety has left me drained. Despite trying numerous antidepressants, my body does not respond well to SSRIs or SNRIs – which are ineffective in my case anyway. The anxiety medications have also fallen short or led to dependence, adding to my struggle. Feeling like a burden due to factors beyond my control is wearing me down, as is the tendency to blame myself for the pain I endure. Finding solace only through numbing substances is disheartening. Enduring the emotional abuse from my mother who shifts blame onto me for her issues, even scolding me for experiencing panic attacks, further adds to my anguish. I reach a breaking point where existence loses its appeal; while others may lament my absence, their current lack of support underscores their duplicity. My very essence aches, and the weight of it all becomes almost unbearable. Despite once yearning for happiness, its elusiveness for over a decade now pushes me towards surrendering. Uncertainty about an afterlife no longer holds significance compared to the desperate need for joy - a pursuit that seems futile lately.

Approaching 30, plagued by long-standing depression and anxiety, I find myself dispassionate about work, resentful of the career path imposed by my family, regretful of past decisions, devoid of romantic relationships or meaningful friendships, lacking in ambitions and goals. Compounded by a unique eye condition that my family struggles to comprehend and that renders me incapable of driving, I suspect I may have had ADHD since childhood, as indicated by persistent signs then and now. However, my family dismisses mental health issues as nonexistent, viewing conditions like depression as mere excuses for laziness and immaturity. My brother accuses me of lacking guilt or shame for being perceived as lazy. Ironically, my mind incessantly administers doses of guilt and shame to reinforce the torment in which I exist. Self-loathing consumes me for my actions, current state, and anticipated future failures, considering myself a failure unworthy of anyone's regard. Even my closest confidante distanced herself from me upon witnessing my depressive state, unable to cope with somber energies. \nI've considered drowning myself, hanging, even leaping from the fourth story of my residence, yet my cowardice thwarted each attempt. I berate myself as worthless, devoid of merit or potential usefulness—questioning the validity of continuing to exist and consume resources better directed elsewhere. Unlike garbage that can be repurposed or recycled into something new, I perceive myself as utterly irredeemable—a useless entity beyond salvage or transformation.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}

Now my family is bombarding me with calls and messages, but honestly, I just want to be alone right now, lying in bed at the hotel. I haven't slept, so I'll try to rest after finishing this message.\n\nThere are countless conflicting emotions swirling in my mind at the moment. Part of me feels certain about my decision, while another part is filled with doubt. It's frustrating, and on top of that, I can't even rent a car yet because I forgot they only accept credit cards for out-of-state renters. So, I had to clear my card balance last night and now I'm waiting for it to process before I can use it. Not really in the mood to go out into the city, so I'll just stay in bed here.

Maybe I'll venture out for food later on, but thankfully, I can go without food or drink for a while.\n\nEveryone seems to care now that things have hit rock bottom and suddenly everyone is worried and showing concern.

Love binds us deeply; parting seems agonizingly inevitable.\n\nThe waiting period feels excruciating as everything falls into place: tickets booked; hotel reservation secured; rental car lined up; finances sorted—but each passing moment drags on interminably like endless weeks stretching into eternity...\n\nPersisting distress leads me aimlessly through dubious online alleys where by chance—or fate—I stumbled upon revealing footage depicting someone resembling my ex-partner engrossed in explicit acts... What twisted cosmic joke! A grim reminder of past suspicions overlooked amidst personal struggles—capitulating into bitter revelations now hauntingly apparent...\n\nMy heedless descent into sleepless oblivion exacerbates as troubling discoveries compound recent turmoil; suspicions regarding infidelities confirmed not solely with one purported paramour from said video but extending towards our former roommate too—an unsettling revelation cast beneath discordant waves...\n\nAcknowledgement prompted aimed disclosures dispatched—a genial gesture at best amidst tumultuous emotions roiling within—an odyssey unfurling toward cessation nears its destined morrow...\n\nImpartial resignation transmitted unto managerial ether serves as epilogue—an unforeseen final chapter unfolds—the solace of anonymous kinship dissipates henceforth amidst earnest wishes of surmounted adversities prevailing over precipitous ends—fare thee well...\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}

From calculating the toxic amount of isopropyl alcohol needed for a slow and painful death by poisoning to testing the durability of potential noose attachment points, and even considering jumping in front of passing cars (which I discarded due to not wanting to traumatize anyone), my mind has wandered into these grim territories far too often. Even in planning these scenarios, I am meticulous in ensuring that my family won't discover me in the act. It's become somewhat of an obsession during quarantine – ideating on self-demise. \n\nI can't recall how this all began, but now the root cause seems simple: I despise myself completely and utterly, unable to muster any self-love or kindness towards myself while effortlessly recognizing the beauty and brilliance in others. It's an ongoing struggle within myself – feeling like an idiot, failure, or emotionally stunted among other self-deprecating labels I can't seem to shake off, especially during moments of vulnerability which seem ceaseless nowadays. Despite attempts from friends and family reassuring me and trying to rationalize against these thoughts, it only plunges me deeper into guilt for causing them worry unnecessarily when they deserve better than worrying about me.\n\nSeeking professional help was daunting with its hefty expenses for continued therapy sessions as medications started losing their effectiveness and stronger ones posed financial constraints. Each attempt at distraction through hobbies or revisiting old passions has fizzled out particularly this year as grief from losing my mother earlier weighs heavily on me, leaving behind anxiety and self-loathing as predominant feelings overtaking any sense of motivation.\n\nThe longing to make her proud used to be my driving force until her passing earlier this year stripped away any semblance of purpose or sentiment beyond anxiety and despair. Feeling culpable for her demise adds another layer of guilt that hinders any ability to find solace or relief from this mental anguish.\n\nAs thoughts grow darker by day and plans for self-harm loom closer, there's a realization that death would be too easy an escape for someone who believes they've caused harm onto others thus deserving punishment through suffering rather than release. Witnessing those who choose death out of sheer willpower inspires respect yet serves as a stark reminder that such a luxury is not one I can afford given how deeply I believe I've inflicted hurt on those around me.\n\nUncertain if this rationale is reason enough to stay bound by life's burdens, it's nevertheless what keeps me tethered for now – this sense of duty to endure rather than succumb despite contemplating various outlets for ending it all. In sharing my thoughts here amidst an internal maelstrom while perusing Reddit threads as an escape from reality momentarily, it felt like contributing my voice among others navigating similar struggles with suicidal ideation.\n\nNot expecting solutions or guidance since doubt clouds every external insight directed towards resolving my inner turmoil mainly due to struggles articulating these emotions accurately; there was simply a desire to engage with this community on shared experiences when feeling isolated in such distressing thoughts.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

All I crave is a sense of happiness and being cherished; that's truly all I desire at this moment. The idea of ending my life before reaching 22 seems nonsensical, but it feels like a way to avoid prolonging my failures and shortcomings. I dread becoming a 30-year-old who still doesn't know how to drive, has never had a significant other, grew up fatherless, never experienced a kiss, or worse, ends up as the 40-year-old still facing bullying. The fear of turning into a 50-year-old virgin or a 60-year-old man without ever owning a home terrifies me. These thoughts weigh heavily on me as another night of deep sadness engulfs me amidst severe anxiety and depression. Frustrations escalate as I grapple with negative emotions - anger towards myself and challenges in managing OCD and depression persist despite trying various medications. The regret of not seizing the opportunity to interact with those two attractive girls during my walk fuels self-loathing and triggers an onslaught of pessimistic thoughts that push me close to tears; revealing my vulnerability as someone who feels inadequate regardless of circumstances.

At times, the temptation arises to alienate people by being purposefully abrasive so that they wouldn't mourn my absence if I were to end it all. The emotional attachments keeping me anchored feel unbearable at times; it's thanks to her presence that I cling precariously on the edge of sanity amid this tumult in my mind which threatens to consume me whole.\n\nThe yearning for an end is strong - envisaging a cease to my woeful narrative and the quieting of thoughts and emotions brings a fleeting sense of peace; however deep down lies an awareness that this narrative doesn’t just conclude for oneself; it ripples destructively through loved ones upon revelation - an image too agonizingly vivid.\n\nThese conflicting feelings about ending it all persist amidst unbearable suicidal ideation where only by terrifying myself with consequences do some semblances of calm manage to seep in temporarily. As much as contempt fills me towards both myself and the world around, fear lingers over how much more devastating the aftermath would be on those left behind.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}
{"prompt":"It's incredibly frustrating when individuals suggest that someone truly struggling with suicidal thoughts should keep it to themselves and end their life quietly. It’s unfair and ignorant to assume that seeking help or sharing feelings is just for attention. Sometimes, holding on and reaching out for support are signs of strength, not weakness. Being labeled as 'attention seeking' when expressing genuine emotions only adds to the pain and makes it harder to open up. It's disheartening that some people may not take these cries for help seriously until it's too late, only to then wonder why the person didn't seek assistance earlier. This kind of dismissive attitude is hurtful and exacerbates the already overwhelming emotions. The frustration expressed here is completely valid, as it’s infuriating to encounter such insensitive remarks in times of deep distress.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" in"}
{"prompt":"They have stripped away my last semblance of stability. I was recently let go from my well-paying, remote, low-pressure job on Wednesday. This job was my only source of stability in my life. I live alone due to escaping from an abusive ex-partner, leaving me without a support system to rely on while I search for a new job. Sharing my situation with my mom is not an option as she has also lost her job, and disclosing this to my dad is difficult due to my pride. Additionally, I am facing the possibility of having to drop out of school. Losing everything that provided me with comfort happened in a five-minute Zoom call. The specialized nature of my former role at work makes it unlikely that I will find a comparable-paying job elsewhere as it is not a widely available skill set. The ability to finally be self-sufficient was the one thing that made me feel somewhat content with being myself, but now that has been taken away from me. It seems like my ex's hurtful words about me being worthless and better off dead are resonating more strongly now that I am faced with this loss. The thought of regaining stability seems distant, if not unattainable for many years, if ever.\n\nThe constant pattern in my life seems to be having any semblance of decency or goodness ripped away from me abruptly. It feels like life is just an endless cycle of struggle and disappointment, where any shred of positivity gained eventually vanishes. At 27 years old, lacking a degree, partner or job leaves me feeling like there's no purpose in persisting any longer. From childhood, I've harbored the belief that existence itself is deceitful; however, fear held me back from taking any drastic steps to end it all earlier – considering others and personal anxieties.\n\nNow the notion holds less weight; there’s apathy towards caring about the emotional consequences on those who may mourn such actions – particularly directed towards my parents who indirectly contributed to my suffering by not investing in my future when they had the capability to do so. If they didn't prioritize securing a better future for me back then, why should their emotions concern me now?\n\nThe idea of driving out into the mountains and finding a remote spot to seek solace through self-harm has crossed my mind as an option worth exploring further – finding peace through rest indefinitely away from this turmoil being an appealing prospect at this point in time.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}
{"prompt":"The relentless battle with these feelings seems never-ending. While I continue to endure for the sake of others, it's not because I harbor a genuine desire to live. It's not just about being unable to envision a promising future for myself; the truth is, I don't even feel inclined towards wanting one. The cycle of improvement followed by relapses, only to find myself back in the same desolate place, is wearing me down. Repetitively extending my own existence has become draining. The struggle to mend myself feels futile when the sole motivation behind it is to make enduring life more bearable for those who care about me. Nevertheless, there are moments when their welfare doesn't hold the same significance anymore. Perhaps that indifference towards others that was mentioned during my PTSD diagnosis (still grappling with accepting it; it never felt severe enough in my eyes) has crept in. The effort I invest in giving affection, time, and effort seems to dissipate eventually, leaving me isolated with that familiar urge for cessation. Presently, there's no immediate threat to my well-being; if at all, any action taken would be months away. I have made tentative plans that provide a semblance of anticipation and prolong this timeline slightly. Deep down, I am aware that should I venture down that path again, failure won't be an option this time around. In the interim, I suppose I am still persevering - an eternal struggle that never ceases.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

{"prompt":"I harbor such intense self-loathing. By and large, I perceive myself as despicable. Despite acknowledging some positive aspects – a handful of talents and virtues – the dominant feeling is one of worthlessness, making me believe that my existence is undesired. My life appears repugnant and pitiful to me; I am consumed by sorrow and perceive myself as unintelligent. The mere thought of others being aware of the torment I endure fills me with a desire to end my life. The longing for suicide is overwhelming. I find myself pondering why there aren't individuals like serial killers who could assist in the euthanasia of those seeking death, categorizing themselves as true drains on society – a label which I firmly believe applies to me. In a world inhabited by 7 billion individuals, not all can be deemed valuable, including myself. I wish for the courage to throw myself in front of a train so that my remains are unrecognizable, guaranteeing my disappearance from public consciousness. The disdain I hold for myself is profound; the shame that accompanies sharing these thoughts weighs heavily on me. My mental state is so disturbed that the desire to escape my own skin intensifies. Another distressing thought is how if I were to take my own life, acquaintances would dissect my existence in search of reasons, which unfortunately wouldn't require much effort as they would soon transition from shock to pity when discussing me. While few hold a genuine concern for me, most relationships are superficial and fleeting due to lack of intimacy. While uncertain about the guidelines here, please refrain from attempting to dissuade me from my feelings of despair. Does anyone feel inclined to encourage or assist me in this act?

This job was not entry-level and losing it has left me feeling utterly unstable. Living by myself because I had to escape an abusive ex who offered no support, I now lack a partner to lean on while I navigate this challenging time. As much as my mom is willing to help, she too has recently lost her job, and out of pride, I can't bring myself to tell my dad about my job loss. Additionally, there's the dilemma of potentially having to quit school due to these circumstances.\n\nThe ease and comfort with which I lived have evaporated in a mere five-minute Zoom call. The nature of my former role was so specific to that particular company that finding a similar paying job elsewhere seems improbable. It's not a skillset easily transferable either. Finally being able to sustain myself financially was the one thing that gave me some sense of contentment with myself, despite the hardships I've faced.\n\nUnfortunately, my ex's hurtful words seem validated now – feeling ugly, useless, and stupid lingers in my mind along with thoughts that maybe life isn't worth enduring after all. The prospect of landing a comparable job feels distant and uncertain – perhaps even unattainable for several years. It's overwhelming how anything good or decent in my life always ends up slipping away.\n\nBeing a 27-year-old woman without a degree or partner in such dire straits makes it hard to see any reason to persist.

{"prompt":"I often find myself wishing I could escape from this overwhelming pain, and at times, I harbor a deep resentment towards my parents. It's puzzling why these emotions consume me when objectively, my life isn't all that bad. I reside comfortably with my parents who can afford to provide for me. Our home is pleasant, and I have the luxury of acquiring things I desire. Additionally, I share a profound bond with my two beloved dogs whom I cherish dearly; the thought of leaving them behind troubles me greatly. Although I'm currently navigating through college with some struggles but on track to graduate in two years, granting me the opportunity to secure a job and attain independence by moving out. Despite my affection for my parents and the acknowledgment that they reciprocate this love vehemently, there are instances when their outbursts trigger overwhelming thoughts within me - making me wish to vanish into thin air when faced with their unpredictable yelling fits. While their anger seldom stems from academic shortcomings but rather trivial issues like finding loose hairs on the floor, it leads me to suspect that my mother may be grappling with OCD tendencies - yet beneath it all, their unwavering love for me remains evident. A part of me senses that perhaps their constant yelling is beyond their control; a reflex they cannot suppress. Maybe if I achieved perfection by excelling academically, maintaining impeccable room hygiene, and assisting more around the house, the severity of their outbursts would decrease - though not completely vanish. Regrettably, summoning the motivation necessary to meet these standards feels like an insurmountable challenge as even arising each morning demands an immense effort; some days barely seeing daylight until noon. The weight of failure lingers heavily upon me as various aspects of my life reveal shortcomings where greater self-discipline is imperative. Battling anxiety and depression daily, taking Adderall and Paxil has provided a degree of relief - empowering me to engage socially and fulfill academic duties competently. Yet, just when it seems like a momentary respite is within reach; the darkness creeps back in relentlessly at times rendering God's presence distant and intangible in my moments of need.

{"prompt":"It all began with that party. Shortly after the start of 2021, my father's friend organized a private pool gathering to celebrate his daughter's company achievement. My family was invited along with a few other close friends. I wasn't keen on attending due to concerns about COVID-19, but declining seemed impolite, especially since it was a private event.\n\nEvery moment of that gathering was unbearable for me. No one there seemed interested in talking to me, not even the others my age. Instead, they were drinking and engaging in public displays of affection in the pool while the adults enjoyed karaoke and laughter. I felt isolated and overlooked, and when I tried to distance myself from them throughout the night, no one even noticed my absence. The whole ordeal triggered a downward spiral for me. I felt utterly disregarded by everyone, and their glances were filled with pity. I resented how they only included me in conversations when prompted by the adults. Once the adults were out of sight, it was as if I became invisible.\n\nThe environment was overwhelming, pushing me to seek refuge in the bathroom for an hour just to escape the noise. I apologize if it comes across as attention-seeking or hypersensitive, but I felt so marginalized and scrutinized during those two days that the memory still haunts me till now. The fear lingers as I worry about being viewed similarly by my peers during virtual classes where their cameras are turned off. I can't comprehend why it affected me so deeply, but it has started affecting my academic performance due to extensive requirements involving interactions with classmates and teachers. This feeling is distressing, and I berate myself for letting such a simple incident have such power over me.

The few individuals in my family who once cared for me, friends who provided solace, and a handful of supportive teachers are no longer present in my life.

Yet, one of them is facing health issues while the other is consistently occupied with their own obligations (and I completely understand their situation). With both of them attending online school and being unavailable during the week, I find myself isolated. While solitude doesn't bother me much, it is essential for my well-being to be completely alone to find peace. Being around others only seems to invite negativity into my life, exacerbating unkind thoughts within me.\n\nAs a high school senior on the younger side, there are at least a couple of years before I can take decisive actions for myself. The realization that distancing myself from those around me would be beneficial dawns on me; however, executing such a change is currently beyond my capabilities.

My mother shows little interest in facilitating therapy for me unless she can control its narrative - which contradicts the role of a therapist who must honor confidentiality.\n\nFinancial constraints and lack of employment prevent me from seeking therapy independently. The emotional burden intensifies as my mother and her boyfriend ridicule everything about me that brings joy or fulfillment. If they were aware of the importance of my two dear friends in my life, they would likely attempt to drive them away through deceitful means.\n\nAcknowledging my imperfections and past mistakes doesn't justify the constant pattern of pushing away those who genuinely care about me; it isn't fair treatment towards them or myself. It seems like there's very little left for me to live for besides the profound love I hold for those two friends; yet even expressing this affection feels perilous under the circumstances.\n\nEnduring an entire year with a keen awareness that something within isn't right while desperately needing assistance is exceedingly challenging.

However, as she struggled with her own mental battles leading to a failed suicide attempt through wrist cutting and subsequent hospitalization in an asylum, I now find myself deeply concerned about her well-being.\n\nWhile she remains uncertain about her future actions regarding suicide post her release from the asylum – during our communication post her ordeal – we discussed the possibility of engaging in such an act together if she reaches that point.\n\nThe thought of losing her has left me feeling completely adrift. Before meeting her again, death seemed like a preferable option; however, without her presence in my life now, I cannot envision continuing on this path.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

I've been through unimaginable hardships and witnessed the depths of human suffering, yet somehow I'm enduring. I'm aware of how fragile this resilience is. To be honest, I don't always wish for it all to end, but there's a multitude of uncertainties and unresolved issues that plague my thoughts constantly - the confusion and fear are overwhelming. Life on Earth is a relentless battle, and while others may have faced more severe trials and survived, in this moment as I pen down these words, all that envelops me is the melancholy solitude that has become a familiar companion lately.

{"prompt":"At 18 years old, uncertainty plagues my mind. I've turned to self-harm as a way to transform emotional pain into physical. The scars that now cover my body trace back to this habit I picked up, starting small and growing over time. Since the age of 12, I've been trapped in a cycle of numbness. Discharged from the military due to psychological concerns, I was referred to a psychiatrist who labeled me as a sociopath with tendencies towards self-harm. The prospect of suicide has lingered in my thoughts for the past month, as life lacks any semblance of joy or love; instead, deceit and unexplained acts of cruelty seem to dominate my interactions.\n\nLast summer, out of habit and her genuine affection for me, I became engaged to a lady who often irks me. Recently, however, an old flame reentered my life with a stark change in demeanor—overcome by depression and haunted by numerous instances of sexual assault. Reconnecting with her sparked unfamiliar emotions within me; perhaps it's our shared troubled past or some other reason unknown to me that draws me to her. Our night together brought a rare feeling of happiness instead of the usual detachment I experience.\n\nUpon waking the next day, thoughts of her consumed me, leading to failed attempts at reestablishing contact when she submerged herself in alcohol and made an unsuccessful suicide attempt by cutting her wrists. Subsequently admitted to an asylum with an uncertain release date looming over us, she tentatively agreed to date me amid wavering thoughts concerning ending her own life. In a pact fraught with desperation and confusion, we decided that if she chooses self-destruction, it shall be together – thus leaving me at a crossroads where the notion of continuing without her presence seems unbearable and potentially insurmountable.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

My mind has become a whirlwind of pent-up emotions and thoughts that ultimately boiled over. The onset of anxiety attacks prompted me to seek medication and contemplate suicide as a means of escape.

Happiness has eluded me for the past two years, and the future seems bleak as if my descent into adulthood is destined for failure. I find myself devoid of passion or purpose, lacking proficiency in anything I attempt. Even simple high school jobs trigger overwhelming anxiety, often leading to tearful breakdowns and resignation.

In summary, working in retail has left me physically drained, yet I can't afford to stop because my family would object. There's a sense of stagnant emptiness in my life, and all I crave when I return home is some rest. And all this for a meager salary that my mother then cuts in half. The thought crosses my mind about whether or not I'll one day reach a point where ending my own life seems like the only option left. It feels like a grim reflection of my current situation. While I don't want to portray myself as a victim, it's hard not to think that circumstances have been orchestrated against me, making success seem almost unattainable. Growing up under the care of a single mother in a household dominated by women seems to have hindered rather than empowered me. Now, stuck in a job that brings me no joy and commuting in a way that's physically wearing me down, it's no wonder I feel like there's no time for recovery. The financial compensation is hardly enough, especially when a chunk of it goes straight towards bills. Saving money becomes challenging and ensuring a good diet is essential since the family’s eating habits are far from ideal. Each month by the next paycheck, my bank balance seems to dwindle into insignificance. It's disheartening. Despite acknowledging my own role in this situation, it feels as though I've been burdened with responsibilities typically shouldered by future partners rather than being encouraged to forge ahead and establish my own family unit. The lack of expectations for me to move forward is disheartening at 27 soon turning 28 this December! I just feel stuck in place – my body constantly worn out, leaving little energy for workouts as rigorous as before. Should I try to make an exit from this cycle, there's a fear that my mother would misinterpret it as mere quitting without looking for other opportunities – although where she got this idea is beyond me.

I am currently in the midst of orchestrating a move and I dread the idea of investing money only to meet my demise soon after. The prospect of failure is unbearable as I have missed the opportune moment, my medication is out of reach, there's no viable place for me to take a leap from, and even my usual method of self-harm seems inadequate. Strangely, it feels like I am on the brink of contentment for once.

The contrast is disheartening as he effortlessly attracts companionship and conversation, leaving me feeling inadequate and destined for failure in college. The overwhelming sense of dread and anxiety has become all-consuming, making it a Herculean task to even get out of bed in the morning, a simple reminder of my educational struggles.

I find myself coveting those who are considered normal, but this envy transforms into resentment. To be frank, I harbor hatred towards anyone who diminishes my sense of humanity, leaving me feeling subhuman – a sentiment that isn't far from reality. My mind convinces me of my own worthlessness and ineptitude; I am engulfed in a sense of failure. If only I were ignorant, perhaps things wouldn't weigh on me so heavily. At times, I fantasize about the blissful ignorance of not comprehending the complexities of this world and finding joy in simple things. However, it's not that I aspire to be unintelligent; no one truly would.\n\nSimilarly, there is an element of yearning for what others possess, yet a reluctance to trade places with anyone else persists within me. This pain seems to define me to some extent, almost as if I'm cautious about letting it go. In fact, there's a strange desire for more suffering within me – a craving for torment and ridicule from all around as if being branded as a failure is my destiny. The nights envelop me in profound solitude, evoking a fear that lingers at the edges of my consciousness. Paradoxically, while craving solitude, hatred towards everyone else prevails within me. Embracing fear seems appropriate; all negative feelings should be acknowledged and felt deeply - even if they manifest as physical pain or emotional distress.\n\nNowadays, concerns about finances weigh heavily on my mind alongside the persistent pain in my tailbone due to what seems to be pilonidal sinus trouble. Despite voicing these health issues to my parents, their initial lack of concern followed by accusations when the problem resurfaces complicates matters further.\n\nThe looming threat of being cast out of the family home while struggling to secure employment adds immense pressure to an already overwhelming situation - made worse by the realization that minimum wage falls far short of offering a chance at stability or self-improvement opportunities I so desperately seek.

The love and longing I feel for him are overwhelming, and facing life feels unbearably painful. The thought of ending everything is constantly on my mind, even though I am reluctant to cause pain to those around me.\n\nI attempted to confide in my friends about my feelings, but their responses were disappointing, ranging from asking me not to bring up his memory as it triggers their anxiety to telling me to simply move on and stop fixating on him.

My relationship with my mom is strained, as she often prioritizes her boyfriend over me and threatens to get rid of me whenever there's an argument. The few allies I had - supportive family members, friendly peers, and understanding teachers - have either drifted away or passed on, leaving me feeling abandoned. It's evident that most people either disregard or wish ill upon me. In the midst of this turmoil, I am grateful for the two friends who show me kindness, even though one of them is unwell and the other is always preoccupied due to online school obligations. Being alone during weekdays exacerbates my negative thoughts and experiences; solitude seems to be my only solace. However, I recognize that distancing myself from toxic influences is necessary but seemingly unattainable at the moment. Attempts to seek help from school authorities have only made matters worse, and my mom shows no interest in supporting therapy unless she can control the narrative - an impossibility in a therapist-client relationship due to confidentiality standards. Lacking financial resources or employment further limits my options for self-improvement. Enduring ridicule from my mom and her partner for my interests and choices adds another layer of pain; revealing details about my friends could potentially lead to further manipulation and isolation orchestrated by them. Recognizing my imperfections, I feel it's unfair for me to unintentionally push away those who care about me. At times like this when life feels bleak, clinging onto precious friendships becomes increasingly challenging. While I hold dear the companionship of these two friends, the thought of burdening them weighs heavily on me; yet, I feel trapped without a clear way out of this predicament.

It seems everyone seeks compliance, yearning for others to conform. I harbor no inclination to adopt an optimistic outlook, exude confidence, or display assertiveness; such attributes elude me. Ironically, if I possessed these qualities, I would shun them altogether - such is my paradoxical stance. Contemplating the myriad choices available to us as humans, I advocate for absolute nonconformity.

I fail to see the value in continuing when I can't find any enjoyment. The only motivation to keep going seems to be for the sake of others who expect me to, and that seems absurd - living not for myself but for the expectations of others is like a cruel joke. While it's true that life has the potential to improve, I can't disregard that possibility completely since the future is uncertain. Even though I can envision various outcomes, none of them seem promising. However, perhaps there exists a rare chance, a one in a billion occurrence, where things could turn around positively. But what seems more probable than that? Life taking a turn for the worse. Just picture if I were to flunk out of college and squander thousands of dollars, or if my unhealthy lifestyle continues eroding my physical well-being leading to suffering. Consider how a simple comment from someone could trigger such intense overthinking on my part, making me believe irrationally that they despise me, although deep down I know it's not true - yet these thoughts caused me to cry as if deeply wounded by their words just last night. It feels almost unavoidable for things to deteriorate further, and if I were to surrender now, at least I wouldn't have wasted all that effort in trying.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}
{"prompt":"I've been wrestling with my suicidal thoughts for what feels like an eternity, and today, I find myself at a breaking point. There hasn't been a specific trigger for my depression or these thoughts of suicide; they've just lingered for as far back as I can remember. Despite undergoing various prescribed treatments, seeing therapists, staying active, forming friendships effortlessly, and making an effort to immerse myself in new experiences in the hopes of discovering my purpose in life, I still find myself succumbing to the grip of suicidal thoughts time and time again. It's a pervasive presence in my life that seems to overshadow everything else. While it used to terrify me and I longed to break free from it, now I feel nothing but apathy and emptiness towards it and everything else life has to offer. I lack the energy to maintain a facade of normalcy or engage with others, devoid of any emotional response. Activities that once brought me joy now feel burdensome chores, and the idea of envisioning a future seems impossible. This sense of detachment from reality due to my suicidal thoughts has persisted for years, leaving me with little reason or desire to continue living. Despite my ability to uphold basic decency, excel at work, and form meaningful relationships in both platonic and romantic contexts in the past, nothing seems worthwhile anymore. I'm reaching my breaking point; today, I acquired rope and although the thought of the pain ahead frightens me greatly, I am consumed by a desperate desire for an end to this suffering.\n\nI have battled with misery for as long as memory serves me; however, this perpetual feeling of emptiness persists even though I have accomplished much and excelled socially in the past. Life has never felt fulfilling; instead, it appears as a series of burdensome tasks rather than enjoyable pursuits. Presently residing under someone else's care post-hospitalization adds another layer of complexity to my situation, compounded by financial woes looming ahead with impending bills that seem insurmountable given my current financial state. The allure of ending it all grows stronger each day despite my apprehension towards the physical pain involved. My attempts at partial suspension hanging proved futile despite meticulous planning; therefore, contemplating a full short drop induces immense fear within me—a fear eclipsed only by the dread of enduring another failed suicide attempt.\n\nThe only thing propelling me through a forthcoming job interview is the hope of earning enough money to purchase a firearm—the sole focus being on acquiring means rather than improving circumstances given the bleak prospects at an undesirable workplace rife with unfavorable working conditions and negative reviews from former employees. If persevering there leads to obtaining sufficient funds within weeks for a shotgun rather than a handgun—a choice influenced solely by concerns over survival—perhaps this alternative method might yield different results.\n\nDepersonalization has rendered suicide as the sole viable option in my mind; every aspect of life seems dulled by an overwhelming numbness that obstructs any sense of attachment or purposefulness. Interactions that once brought solace now feel burdensome efforts that I am reluctant to engage with further. Setting objectives feels like unnecessary stress without any tangible benefits since every action is swiftly questioned by thoughts veering towards self-harm instead.\n\nLiving with depression has been a constant companion throughout my existence; however,...\n\n(If you need me to continue rephrasing this passage or if you need further assistance in rephrasing other sections from Reddit posts please let me know.)\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}

Sharing the extent of my struggles with them was deeply humiliating and distressing; it's left me feeling overwhelmed with shame. While I dislike the idea of residing with them again, it seemed like the only option besides contemplating suicide. The knowledge that they now possess about my situation makes me physically ill.\n\nIn a moment of desperation, I poured out everything to my mom via text, which led to the decision of leaving college and arranging the move back home. The prospect of going through with this fills me with dread as I find it challenging to coexist with my family. There's a sense of impending regret looming over me. The thought of an easy way out by ending my life lingers in my mind.\n\nI'm struggling immensely. In a moment of weakness, the idea of taking numerous pills crossed my mind tonight, knowing it wouldn't be enough to end everything but feeling tempted nonetheless. My current state has caused me to give up entirely; academics have taken a backseat, and meeting obligations feels impossible. Living independently has become an insurmountable task.\n\nI am trapped in a dark place without a clue on how to navigate through this turmoil. Despite acknowledging that I need help, the lack of desire to seek improvement adds another layer of complexity. Contemplating hospitalization crosses my mind, yet the fear of how my parents would react stops me in my tracks.\n\nThe burden of suffering silently for so long has become unbearable; it seems like I've hit rock bottom. Should I be honest with my parents about needing time off from college to focus on recovery? However, their potential dismissal that attributes depression solely to unemployment poses another hurdle.\n\nCaught between wanting an escape from life yet unable to take drastic actions towards it is a torturous position I find myself in presently.

Their emotional manipulation by suggesting that my actions would condemn them to a lifetime of misery felt incredibly selfish; the notion that I should continue living solely for their benefit is unjust. The subsequent chaos of arguments that ensued is now a blur, with certain hurtful remarks driving me towards an immediate end. Criticisms about not opening up to them but confiding in a therapist, along with suggestions for joining the military for purpose and comments on my difficulty with eye contact, only added to the emotional turmoil.

Why resort to methods like hanging, drowning, overdosing, or self-harm when a single decisive action could suffice? All it takes is precision. Perhaps hiring someone to assist would be wise. The thought of my beloved pets starving if I were to no longer exist haunts me. I've cared for them since childhood and they hold a special place in my heart (for those curious, they are dogs).\n\nMy parents never held affinity for animals; their neglect during my brief absences exemplifies this. They barely provided water and food, a duty I always prepared for with extra rations before leaving them under my parents' care. Their well-being is non-negotiable for me. However, permitting an existence such as mine – a mere waste of oxygen – to persist is something I cannot justify. Acting impulsively, I made a regrettable mistake by self-inflicting a minor wound with a knife; however, that's not the essence of the issue at hand. Right now, the temptation to overdose on pills is strong, despite being aware of the excruciating demise it brings. It would contradict my previous advice to someone attempting the same method and urging them towards medical help.\n\nThe wound is superficial compared to the pain within me.

Sometimes, impulsively driving a knife into my heart seems like an appealing option amidst overwhelming hatred towards the world.\n\nHave you ever felt intense hatred towards those accountable for your suffering?

Returning to online platforms discussing suicidal inclinations after an extended hiatus since January opened doors towards exploring varied methods mentioned in their resources and engaging in discussions with fellow users contemplating alternative options.\n\nNonetheless, this feels definitive - by next year’s end, I'll cease to exist.

While some days offer a glimmer of hope, most days feel like my body is merely a vessel for a heart that feels cold and shattered, yet strangely still harbors a warmth within. In the past, my very essence has been repeatedly stripped away, leaving me to feel as though I have been through the harshest trials of life. Witnessing and enduring unimaginable hardships has been a common theme in my journey. Despite it all, I remain resilient. I understand the value of this resilience, and to be honest, I'm not always consumed by the desire to vanish completely. However, there exists a multitude of uncertainties and unresolved aspects in my life that leave me feeling lost and fearful much of the time; unsure about my past actions, present circumstances, and what lies ahead. Life on this Earth is undeniably challenging, with many individuals enduring worse fates and emerging victorious.

Unfortunately, my recent attempts at creating art left me drained and disheartened when the results fell short.

However, the influence of capitalism and society's emphasis on immediate satisfaction has taken a toll on my mental well-being. This was not how it was supposed to be for me, but here I am. I'm lost about where to go from here or what lies ahead for me. Uncertainty clouds every thought, leaving me feeling adrift. I cling to the hope that this phase will pass soon, though there's no guarantee.

{"prompt":"I am a 21-year-old guy and it feels like I may never find love. My mental and emotional instability, along with my perceived oddness and unattractiveness, make me believe that I am incapable of being loved. All I yearn for is to find a woman to love and share my life with, but I have this deep-rooted belief that I am a failure and will ultimately end up alone. It's incredibly daunting to even think about how to approach my parents for help. Despite being diagnosed with moderate depression and anxiety and making efforts such as abstaining from alcohol, my condition seems to be worsening, leaving me unable to even get out of bed some days, consumed by thoughts of ending my life. With no friends left to turn to, my only recourse seems to be seeking therapy and medication, which I can't afford on my own. However, breaking the news to my parents is challenging since I've never been very open with them about such personal struggles.\n\nThe pattern of self-sabotage in my life continues relentlessly at 21; every effort at self-improvement seems futile as thoughts of dying alone loom over me. Following a fallout with all my friends, the loneliness weighs heavy on me, pushing me towards thoughts of death as an escape from this painful reality. Though the idea of ending it all may seem like a solution tonight, the fear or incapacity to take that final step shows that deep down inside I am hesitant about death yet find it hard to envision any other way out due to feeling like an outcast.\n\nAs another Valentine's Day passes by bringing forth feelings of isolation and inadequacy due to never having experienced a romantic relationship and feeling alienated from society, drowning those emotions in alcohol seems like the only temporary relief before contemplating more permanent measures like suicide. The weight of disappointment I bear towards myself burdens me immensely making me believe the world would be better off without someone like me around.\n\nThe narrative in my mind convinces me that given how I oversexualize women consistently, forming any genuine connection seems improbable; consumed by this distortion both in real life interactions and when consuming media content makes initiating or maintaining relationships seem daunting afters years grappling with these concerns without resolution. While others celebrate love on Valentine's Day surrounded by loved ones, the day serves as a stark reminder of how isolated and different one can feel when abandoned by friends while struggling deeply with feelings of inadequacy.\n\nFortifying these negative beliefs year after year has taken its toll on how Valentine’s Day now signifies not just loneliness but also acts as a stark mirror reflecting back insecurities about personal worth creating an overwhelming desire for this anguish to come to an end swiftly rather than bear its weight indefinitely amid a world seemingly teeming with lovers whose existence underscores one's own perceived shortcomings repeatedly reinforcing self-loathing instead of fostering self-compassion or hope for something better ahead.''\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

However, deep down, I truly believe that I am unworthy of life. I have become a self-centered and complaining individual who lacks the motivation or desire to improve my own circumstances. Instead of taking steps towards positivity, all I seem to do is exasperate those who may wish to support me in my journey to recovery – a path that I feel undeserving of treading. The idea of a quick end, perhaps by a bullet to the head, seems justified in my mind. My sole repertoire consists of lamenting about my existence, yet have I truly made any sincere efforts to change things for the better? The reality is no. Despite vocalizing my loneliness, have I actively sought companionship? The answer remains no. Even if I were to reach out for help, would it actually make a difference? It appears unlikely, as I am perpetually consumed by my own anguish and inadequacy, neglecting the needs and concerns of others around me.

Recently, my family had a big argument about our issues and it's left me feeling really down. The truth is, I've been battling suicidal thoughts for about six years now, ever since I survived an attempt at 14 but just barely made it through. Since then, there have been a few other close calls, but nothing successful. Returning to my home country hasn't solved anything; I find myself facing the same struggles. My girlfriend has been my rock through all the pain, yet my family doesn't approve of her. Initially, they were running a program helping people who couldn't afford visa payments - including her. But as soon as they disapproved of our relationship, everything changed and she had to leave. Despite constantly longing to be together, circumstances seem to conspire against us. I can't save up enough money to visit her in Australia due to my current situation. Keeping in contact with her without my family knowing adds another layer of complexity to this already suffocating situation. It's incredibly disheartening; it feels like there's no purpose left in striving for happiness when all I feel is the isolation of a desolate room, watching everyone else move ahead with their lives while their significant others are by their side - something I yearn for but can't have at the moment. Still, deep down inside me lies a flicker of hope that one day we will overcome these obstacles and truly be together despite the distance and opposition we face daily in our relationship that's already weathered a year apart after just three months together physically. It's immensely frustrating dealing with a Christian family that views our connection as against God's will when I truly believe that love is divine and should be celebrated by Him who created it. Yet this decision isn't mine to make or change their perspective on it no matter how strongly I feel or wish otherwise. At this point, continuing on feels like an unbearable burden; it seems like this world simply doesn't have a place for me in its grand scheme of things even if leaving seems like an appealing option given the circumstances surrounding us being apart physically while connected emotionally across distances tearing at my heart every time her tears come up in memory - I'm trapped in solitude feeling lost and powerless simultaneously as if waiting for some miracle out of reach yet hoped for desperately amidst this excruciating limbo of uncertainty about if things would ever fall into place just right eventually or forever stay askew despite wanting nothing more than for everything to work out somehow against all odds because life isn’t guaranteed happiness for everyone no matter how ardently they wish otherwise\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}

The descriptions hurled at me then were entirely accurate. Yes, I did attempt to peep under girls' skirts, influenced by the anime I was fixated on at that time.

A job at my mother's workplace was handed to me just to keep me out of trouble; however, even that safety net disappeared as I was dismissed for revealing suicidal tendencies during my probationary period.\n\nAbove all else, loneliness consumes me.

Despite my efforts to resist feeling this way, I find it difficult. From a young age, I faced constant bullying and mistreatment from both peers and even some teachers who turned a blind eye or encouraged the cruelty towards me. The relationship with my mom is strained, as she often prioritizes her boyfriend over me, threatening to abandon me during our arguments. Regrettably, those in my family who showed me love, friends who were supportive, and a few understanding teachers have all drifted away - the friends have vanished, family members passed on, and those mentors are no longer in my life. Additionally, distant relatives and cousins have long forgotten about me or never truly cared. It feels as though most people wish for my demise.\n\nAmidst all these hardships, I am fortunate to have two friends who show care for me for reasons unknown even though one of them may be facing health issues while the other is always occupied (I hold no resentment towards them; it just pains me that we can't spend more time together). As they are engrossed in their online studies throughout the week, I find myself isolated. While solitude is usually fine by me, being alone is when I feel most at ease. Negative occurrences tend to arise when I am amidst others, leading to unkind thoughts plaguing my mind.\n\nGiven that I am only a high school senior on the younger side with possibly another year or two before taking significant steps towards change is daunting. Awareness dawns that distancing myself from current surroundings is necessary for my well-being; however, undertaking such action seems out of reach presently.

Initiating therapy independently remains beyond reach due to financial constraints and lack of employment.\n\nThe situation becomes more burdening as my interests and actions are met with ridicule by my mother and her partner. Should they learn about my two friends, they may drive them away through deception and animosity—a pattern that forces me into constantly pushing away those close to me unfairly; a circumstance that feels undeserved.\n\nWith little motivation in life apart from cherishing the presence of these two individuals in my life deeply, it's painful to consider burdening them further while feeling lost within this seemingly endless yearning for help amidst visible internal turmoil which escalates daily.\n\nA promise made under duress looms over graduation night as an escape route should circumstances fail to improve—an eventuality where attending graduation also lacks appeal due to the absence of connection or belonging there from both ends blended with personal disinterest in participating further.\n\nThe urge to end this agony by inflicting harm upon myself grows stronger each passing day while hope dwindles rapidly.\"Situation continues to deteriorate.\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}
{"prompt":"A Brief Long Tale: Greetings, everyone. I have been grappling with depression for an extended period, dating back to my early school years, and it has only worsened over time. At present, at 19 years old, my life seems to be spiraling out of control. Both of my parents have passed away (my mother almost four years ago and my father close to five), and I endured mental and physical abuse from my mother, despite harboring no resentment towards her. I understand she was struggling with numerous mental health issues. My father had been absent from my life since I was around 11-12 years old; my mother's passing was due to sleep apnea and an enlarged heart, while my dad died in a car accident. They were estranged from each other, and their absence is deeply felt. Moving forward, the first time I tried to take my own life involved using a phone charger when I couldn't find any rope, overwhelmed by a sense of hopelessness. Following that attempt, I made a promise to myself that I would enlist in the military and perish in combat, but that changed after moving in with my aunt and uncle. Things appeared to be looking up - school was going well, I had friends and family supporting me through thick and thin, lauding me as one of the strongest individuals they knew. However, deep down, I felt like a fraud - achieving things solely through the support and love of others. My high school graduation and college acceptance were all thanks to their relentless push; yet once college started, everything began unraveling at an alarming rate. My academic performance plummeted, signaling the end of relying on others' goodwill. My motivation waned, jeopardizing my current job status. Despite multiple suicide attempts, the thought of inflicting pain on my family has always deterred me. Each day becomes more burdensome; recently being arrested for possessing shrooms (considered a felony where I reside), spending two harrowing nights behind bars exacerbated matters further. The only way out seems to be improving my grades which appears insurmountable given the massive backlog of classes and assignments missed. Vulnerable as it may sound, expressing my emotions is not something that comes easy - every inquiry about how I am feeling is met with deceitful reassurance on my part exacerbating the mental strain. Death now seems like the ultimate resolution; perhaps bringing closure and cohesion within my fractured family where all I've brought are problems pushing everyone away from me.\n\nSince relocating to campus, it appears that things are improving within my aunt and uncle's household now that I am absent from the equation. Lately, thoughts have veered towards contemplating methods of ending it all convincingly like an accident as research yields only references to hotlines when what's sought is an outlet sans telephone interaction due to anxiety surrounding phone conversations - hence this online purge instead.\n\nThank you for delving into what feels akin to a TED Talk from me; apologies for any lapses in grammar or punctuation amidst these musings.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}

{"prompt":"I believe that death is a kindness I haven't earned. Despite struggling with suicidal thoughts for years, I was only recently diagnosed with psychological issues. I chose not to share this burden with my parents due to the exorbitant fees associated with psychologists and psychiatrists in my country. I must admit that I have been neglecting my appointments with my psychologist and school counselors on a regular basis, partly for the same financial reasons (they can't charge me if I don't schedule appointments). The idea of ending my life has become a persistent presence, almost like a hobby now. During this extended period of quarantine, I've dedicated considerable time to contemplating and planning various ways to bring about my own demise within the confines of my home. I've meticulously calculated the amount of isopropyl alcohol required for a lethal poisoning. I've tested the durability of potential hanging points to assess their ability to support my weight. I've even strategized about timing myself to potentially jump in front of the noisy person's sports car when they leave their house (although ruled out due to not wanting to traumatize them). Ensuring that my family does not interrupt me mid-attempt has also been part of these dark musings. It's almost ironic how this morbid ideation has become a significant part of my quarantine routine. Somewhere along the way, hating myself has emerged as the primary reason behind these suicidal desires—plain and simple. Despite admiring the wonder and beauty in others, recognizing their innate worth as human beings, I find it impossible to extend any form of self-love towards myself. Instead, insults and self-deprecation flood my mind during moments of vulnerability which seem incessant lately: fool, disappointment, coward, sloth, burden, failure, damaged goods, hypocrite – these are the harsh labels that echo in my head constantly. People assure me that this phase will pass; however, current circumstances suggest otherwise as every effort made thus far to alleviate these feelings has fallen short during this chaotic year following my mother's passing early on. Struggling with an overwhelming sense of guilt regarding her death adds another layer to the inner turmoil intensifying every negative emotion within me - anxiety and self-hatred have taken deep root in me since then. Seeking solace through friends or professional help remains unattainable due to financial constraints coupled with medication failing to provide effective relief as before; stronger alternatives are financially out of reach as well making treatment unfeasible in the long run.

My dog, who is 14 years old, tends to bark and growl at me whenever I pass by while someone else is eating. According to my family, they think it's because she perceives me as 'weak' due to my initial fear of dogs when we first brought her home. This explanation just adds to my feelings of guilt and self-loathing, and it's foremost on my mind every time this situation unfolds. This evening, it occurred twice. During the first instance, I yelled at her to be quiet, and in the second instance, I lost control and even threatened harm while tossing a blanket in her direction. My mother was present, and she mentioned being frightened by my actions. This whole experience has left me deeply concerned that I might end up hurting someone dear to me in the future. It's causing me to pull away from forming any new relationships (not that I would consider it at this point) because I fear I might exhibit similar outbursts.

The weight of untreated health anxiety engulfs me as even the simplest act of cleaning a light switch triggered a paralyzing fear that I have damaged my internal organs or heart. The relentless cycle of anxiety persists despite a clear EKG and normal heartbeat, leaving me feeling incapable of carrying on.

A sense of impending doom haunts me; the idea of ending everything once I turn 21 looms ominously - even if against my true desires. Perhaps this message serves as nothing more than a fleeting thought or a plea for solace; the rationale escapes me. The sense of perpetual immaturity persists within me unabated; feelings of listlessness and tearful outbursts have become routine comforts. Do you ever find yourself grappling with mental blocks hindering clear thinking?

It's become a dominating aspect of who I am. While it used to terrify me and I yearned to feel differently, now I'm just indifferent and empty towards everything, lacking the energy to maintain appearances or connect with others. My emotions have dulled, my once-beloved hobbies now feel burdensome chores, and envisioning any sort of future feels impossible.\n\nThis sense of detachment from life has intensified over the past couple of years, making me feel utterly devoid of reasons or desires to continue living. Despite knowing that something is not right within me, I've reached a point where this bleak outlook has become my default state.

If someone battling mental health challenges or contemplating suicide still harbors a desire to have children, that's their choice, and I won't pass judgment.

{"prompt":"I feel like things are never going to improve, and I'm not sure how much longer I can keep going like this. It's hard for me to hold on. Despite knowing I shouldn't feel this way, it's overwhelming and I can't shake it off. Growing up, I experienced relentless bullying, with even some of my teachers turning a blind eye or joining in. My relationship with my mom is strained; she often makes it clear that her boyfriend means more to her than I do, threatening to kick me out during arguments. The few family members, friends, and supportive teachers I had are no longer around - friends have drifted away, family members have passed away, and those understanding teachers are a thing of the past. My extended family and cousins have long forgotten about me and never showed much affection in the first place. It feels like most people wouldn't mind if I weren't here anymore. In the midst of all this darkness, there are two friends who show they care about me for some reason, but one of them might be dealing with their own issues and the other is always occupied due to online schooling - which I completely understand but still leaves me feeling lonely during the week. Being alone is okay for me in general but being around others brings negativity and unkind thoughts that overwhelm me. Unfortunately, being a high school senior on the younger side means that my options are limited for now; getting away from these toxic surroundings seems impossible at the moment. Attempts to seek help from school authorities only made things worse for me, and my mom isn't interested in supporting therapeutic interventions unless she can control what information is shared - which defeats the purpose of seeking help. Financial constraints prevent me from seeking therapy independently as well since I lack a job or resources. The constant ridiculing from my mom and her boyfriend about my interests creates an additional layer of difficulty; should they find out about my two friends, they'd likely sabotage those relationships too by spreading falsehoods about me. While acknowledging that I'm not flawless and have made errors, constantly driving away my friends feels unjustified; deep down inside, I don't believe I deserve such treatment. It's challenging to find reasons to keep going when everything feels so bleak. Although I cherish my two close friends deeply and wouldn't want to hurt them, sometimes it all becomes too overwhelming - living through another year knowing something isn’t right with me is daunting beyond words. Not long ago did I imagine things reaching this level of despair where graduation night seems like an endpoint rather than a celebration; attending the ceremony holds no appeal as there's nothing there for me - it seems nobody really wants me there either, including myself.

It frustrates me that so many people would view such a decision as selfish.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}
{"prompt":"I'm a 21-year-old guy, and it feels like love is something I'll never get to experience. My mental and emotional struggles make me believe I'm not deserving of love. On top of that, I feel like an outsider, unattractive and peculiar. All I truly desire is to find a partner to share my life with, but deep down, I fear that my perceived shortcomings label me as a failure doomed to lead a solitary existence. Confronting my parents about needing assistance seems like an overwhelming task. Despite being diagnosed with moderate depression and anxiety and making the choice to abstain from alcohol, my battle with depression seems only to have intensified. The heaviness in my heart hinders even the simplest tasks like getting out of bed, leading me to contemplate the idea of ending it all. With the loss of all my friends, seeking therapy and potentially medication appears to be my sole lifeline. However, admitting to my parents that I require therapy because I cannot afford it poses a challenge since I've never been one to openly communicate with them about personal struggles. It feels as though I am continuously self-sabotaging any chance at a fulfilling life. At 21 years old, the pattern of repeated failures suggests that loneliness and ultimately death are what await me. Even though desperation lingers within me, cowardice holds me back from ending my own life; instead, I find myself passively hoping for an end. The sense of isolation that accompanies Valentine's Day serves as a poignant reminder of my perpetual solitude and lack of romantic connections. The absence of past relationships coupled with toxic interactions leading to the alienation of friends only drives me further towards thoughts of self-harm as a means to escape suffering. To everyone disappointed by my actions, I offer an apology while convincing myself that perhaps the world would benefit from my absence. My tendency to view women through a solely sexual lens has warped my perceptions and created barriers in forming meaningful relationships; this realization perpetuates feelings of fear and guilt shrouding any interaction with women in apprehension. As another Valentine's Day rolls around, the temptation to drown sorrows in alcohol heightens as thoughts linger on potential drastic actions overnight hoping not to face another day filled with loneliness and despair fueled by reminders of personal inadequacy on this holiday designated for lovey-dovey connections celebrated by seemingly everyone except myself.\n\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}
{"prompt":"Why is it always the insignificant things that become the breaking point for me, leading me to contemplate ending it all? I'm aware that to others this may seem trivial. The incident that triggered a surge of anger, sadness, and a feeling of utter disillusionment with the world was my parents deciding to confine the kittens in their room at night to prevent them from sleeping on my bed. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, I had been solely responsible for caring for their new kittens for a few weeks before returning home to visit them within our support bubble agreement. As a result of my dedicated care during those nearly three weeks, the kittens have grown quite attached to me. I had hoped to spend quality time here for a week - I even took time off work specifically for this visit - but now I realize the naivety in expecting my parents to share that same enthusiasm with the kittens present. Instead of making an effort to bond with the kittens, they appear indifferent and react with jealousy and irritation when the kittens gravitate towards me. The fact that they are now confined in my parents' bedroom without access to essentials like water and a litter tray has left me seething with anger. Is it wrong for me to feel this way? Why does this particular situation drive me to tears in the garage at 3am, overwhelmed with guilt despite simply trying to be helpful, while battling the temptation to wander off into the night uncaring about what happens next? Part of me almost wishes for something unfortunate to happen just so I wouldn't have to grapple with these tumultuous thoughts anymore. The strained relationship with my parents, characterized by emotional and spiritual abuse since my teenage years or even earlier, has always been a source of struggle. Being here fills me with an overwhelming desire not to exist. Feeling utterly isolated, I find myself at my wit's end. Amidst all this chaos, even a migraine exacerbates these emotions further. While there are undoubtedly deeper issues at play here, why does this seemingly trivial matter serve as the tipping point? It makes me feel foolish and invalidates these emotions, particularly concerning the kitten incident. It infuriates me that they believe confining the kittens will create a sense of security when it took weeks for them to trust me – a process my parents have only just begun in two days' time. After spending hours trying unsuccessfully to untangle all these complexities in my life right now, I find myself unable to see any glimmer of hope or resolution on the horizon. Everything seems bleak; I long for an escape from it all and yearn for nothing more than uninterrupted slumber - yet sleep eludes me. Vanishing appeals more than existing presently; apologies for venting with such intensity amidst this turmoil weighing heavy on my heart right now.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

Career pursuits, wealth accumulation, material possessions - they all seem like manufactured illusions aimed at exploiting our vulnerabilities and actually leaving us poorer rather than enriched. We find ourselves enslaved by our routines, and I am of the opinion that any fiction turned into reality should be eradicated for its manipulative effects on people, even when it comes to something as universal as music. It's bewildering how we've allowed these fictional constructs to wield such control over us, including the concept of money. The desire to live has faded within me. If only someone could end my existence.\n\nThe notion of death seems elusive and unattainable. Life holds no sway over me. It feels as though we are all participants in a twisted experiment where the horrors of the past persist and dehumanize us in a never-ending simulation. Why prolong this charade? I yearn for release from family obligations, unbothered by potential repercussions or consequences. As a man, society deems me disposable; I simply wish to wither away into nothingness. The thought of progeny is repulsive; with overpopulation already rampant, there is no need to add more souls to this world.\n\nIs there a swift path to death? I am resolute in my desire to depart from this world. We are shackled by the chains of currency and familial ties that sustain our existence against our will.

Our bondage to capitalism mirrors the atrocities of history; reduced to mere statistics in an unjust game.\n\nEnslaved by money, music, and technology until eventual demise - what purpose lies in persisting? It is disheartening how we've succumbed to fictitious constructs like music\/technology\/money\/government\/corporations\/society\/the establishment, relinquishing our autonomy piece by piece . This existential servitude leaves me devoid of will to continue on this path.\n\nThe thought of labor repulses me; an end to this existence is preferable. Indifferent and weary, my male birth feels like an inadvertent mistake propagated through generations devoid of foresight or consideration for long-term consequences. Motivation eludes me as societal pressures dictate finding employment solely for exacerbating existing issues perpetuated by the establishment's insatiable greed.\n\nEmbracing an Amish lifestyle holds allure with its simplicity amidst chaos.

{"prompt":"I feel like I can't go on anymore. Hi there. Although we're strangers, I think maybe letting it all out here could help. Recently, my family got into a massive argument about our issues and struggles. I've been battling suicidal thoughts for around six years now – my first attempt was at 14 and it was a close call. Since then, I've had a few more brushes with death but never gone through with it. Upon returning to my home country, I found myself in the same difficult situation. My girlfriend has been my rock through all the pain, yet my family doesn't approve of her. They used to run a school for those struggling to afford their visas, but when they disagreed with me being fond of her, they shut down the school and she had to leave. We talk about wanting to be together constantly, but circumstances have made it seem nearly impossible. Financially, I can't save up enough to visit her as I cannot go back to Australia right now. Keeping in touch with her without my family's knowledge adds to the strain. It's unbearable; I don't see the point anymore in pursuing happiness when all I feel is like a solitary teenager spending his days in a dark room longing for something good to happen. Quitting school has only amplified this feeling as I watch everyone else progress with their lives, sharing them with their partners and expressing how much they miss them when apart. Despite everything that stands in our way, I hold onto hope that eventually we will unite permanently. We've tackled a year of long-distance and spent three precious months together before she had to depart again. It's challenging dealing with a Christian family that deems being with her as contradictory to God's will; however, I believe that if God created love, He would approve of ours. Unfortunately, the decision is not mine to make. The thought of continuing on doesn’t resonate within me anymore; it’s been quite a journey but perhaps this world just isn't meant for me after all. What makes matters worse is even if I decide otherwise, circumstances inhibit me from acting upon it. The mere idea of her tears brings me immense pain – stuck and alone is an understatement of how I feel right now. Essentially what I'm trying to convey is this: If you have your beloved by your side – that person you would move mountains for – cling onto them tightly because life is fleeting and not everyone gets that fairy-tale ending they yearn for\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}
{"prompt":"Venting about my self-loathing. Just recently joined but facing a major issue. I'm a 30-year-old single father to a soon-to-be 8-year-old boy. Financially, I barely manage to pay the bills, but we do have food and a roof over our heads. The cloud of depression has loomed over me even before his birth. The abandonment by his mother, who cheated and walked out on us four years back, only worsened things (though not officially diagnosed by a doctor, I assume due to my perpetual pessimism and lack of will to carry on). As I age, thoughts of departing this world feel more comforting. Of course, I'll hold on until he's grown, but pulling my life together seems impossible. My dream jobs remain out of reach due to my unrelated work background. Women overlook me due to my \"dad bod.\" It seems like a series of dead ends and constant failure. The drive is gone, and despite attempts, I view myself as insignificant. The complexity of existence is overwhelming. While I won't label myself as suicidal because I lack the courage to go through with it, in around 11 years, maybe then I could consider it; for now, my son doesn't deserve that fate. He simply has an unsuccessful father he likely feels embarrassed about. How does one cope with the agony of living?

To make matters worse, when my girlfriend confided in a friend about what had happened, he callously dismissed it as a lie and labeled me as a fake cutter. It's disheartening to think that some individuals are so quick to doubt and belittle someone's struggles without understanding the depth of their pain.

It doesn't inspire me to rebel and indulge in life simply because I've detached from all obligations and await my inevitable fate. The concept of defining oneself through a distinct personality or adhering to societal standards of morality is wearisome. Everyone seems to desire you to conform to their ideals. I have no desire to embrace optimism, exude confidence, or display assertiveness – skills that elude me entirely.

Perhaps it's time for me to reflect my true sentiments towards humanity by adopting a more abrasive demeanor towards others.

While I struggle with strong bipolar tendencies akin to those of my past abusive uncle, I am determined never to cause physical harm to anyone. However, I do grapple with the fear of being adept at manipulation, which is unsettling as I strive not to become that kind of person. Despite feeling consistently lonely and directionless, uncertain about my purpose, overall, things seem slightly better compared to how they've been in the past. There's a gradual sense of self-recognition and acceptance taking shape, regardless of whether I find myself content with who I am at the moment or not.

The medications prescribed for anxiety also fall short or lead to dependency issues, leaving me feeling overwhelmed. It weighs heavily on me that I inadvertently burden others with my struggles, even though I can scarcely control how I feel. The fleeting moments of joy I do experience often stem from substances altering my state of mind, a reality that is disheartening.

During a visit to a friend's lake house in April, I took a fall from a tire swing barely two feet off the ground, landing directly on my back. Initially, there wasn't much change but that night I felt unwell and fatigued. Two days later, back home, I started feeling odd with a persistent foggy and fuzzy sensation in my head.\n\nAfter about a week, upon consulting my regular doctor, she diagnosed it as a concussion even though I didn't exhibit the typical symptoms apart from the fogginess. Following this diagnosis, a neurologist confirmed it was post-concussion syndrome.

Turning to a naturopathic doctor well-versed in natural remedies raised hopes of alleviating my symptoms.

The lengthy winter we experienced here in Denmark during the lockdown exacerbated my lingering sense of unfulfilled goals and disconnected relationships. It deepened my feelings of loneliness to an unprecedented degree.

Sleep became elusive, with frequent awakenings plaguing my nights. During this dark period, unsettling thoughts crept into my mind – contemplations on finding peace outside of this existence. The notion of these thoughts manifesting into something more alarming startled me, prompting a stark realization that I was teetering on the edge of despair, even though acting upon it had never seriously crossed my mind.

However, I'm stuck in this situation for the foreseeable future, having to go back to their house until January 19th. Despite trying to empower myself, I can't shake off the feeling of being trapped amidst those who have caused me so much pain. The dynamic at home is suffocating with a mother consumed by religious fervor and heavily focused on my autistic sister, leaving me isolated in my distress.\n\nOn top of that, there are layers of \"normal\" trauma stemming from how poorly I've been treated by my family. From being coerced into buying a car while struggling with a minimum wage job to dealing with insurance issues after accidents, it's been a relentless cycle of neglect and disregard for my well-being. Sacrificing my own mental health for the sake of others has become the norm, with my feelings consistently dismissed or twisted into blame against me. Even when facing extreme challenges like surviving meningitis and losing hearing in one ear, any expression of trauma is met with dismissive remarks like \"just relax\" or \"don't blame your father\".\n\nThe lack of support and understanding extends beyond the family circle to my experiences at school where I find myself surrounded by an overwhelming wave of radical left social justice warriors. Their tendency to assign guilt collectively based on race or other broad factors only adds to the toxicity that surrounds me daily. Being older than most of them only serves to alienate me further as they exist within their own echo chamber, unable to comprehend my more nuanced perspective.\n\nThe dream of living a normal life was shattered long ago by the continuous turmoil within my family. Choices made for their benefit have only deepened my struggles, such as giving up on college when it was within reach due to parental decisions about retirement and financial instability at home during critical times.

Currently experiencing a severe depressive episode exacerbated by my bipolar 1 disorder that I've been managing for around 7 years. The pandemic and juggling two jobs have eliminated my usual coping mechanisms like painting, setting small goals, and seeking human interaction. These strategies are inaccessible right now, pushing me further into despair. While I'm not an immediate danger to myself, the situation is precarious and could escalate. Despite reaching out to family and friends for support, their responses have been unsupportive and dismissive. My sister labeled my venting as whining and urged me to focus on practical solutions instead of dwelling on circumstances out of my control. Similarly, my parents advised me to concentrate on the positive aspects. The barrier preventing me from seeking medical help is the lack of insurance until the beginning of next month, coupled with recently starting a new part-time teaching job just two weeks ago. Disappearing without explanation would only complicate matters for the staff or staying on could create challenges with classroom management post-absence. It's a tough dilemma. Waiting until February 1st seems like a daunting task in the realm of depression timeframes.

At present, I am 19 years old, and my life appears to be in complete disarray. Both my mother and father have passed away (my mother about 4 years ago and my father nearly 5), and I endured mental and physical abuse from my mother, though strangely I harbor no resentment towards her. Despite acknowledging that her actions were unacceptable, I understand that she was grappling with various mental health issues herself. My father had been absent from my life since I was around 11 or 12, while my mother's passing was due to sleep apnea and an enlarged heart, and my father died in a car accident. They were separated, but I deeply miss them both.\n\nOn a different note, the first time I attempted suicide was using a phone charger when I couldn't locate any rope, feeling utterly hopeless. After that incident, I made a promise to myself that I would enlist in the military and perish in combat; however, that changed shortly after moving in with my aunt and uncle. Things seemed to be looking up - excelling in school despite loathing myself - life appeared to be on an upward trajectory. Friends and family praised me as one of the strongest individuals they knew, assuring me of their unwavering support no matter what. Nevertheless, it dawned on me that all my accomplishments were merely a result of relying on the care and encouragement of others.\n\nI completed high school and secured admission into college thanks to their relentless pushing; however, things took a drastic downturn once college commenced at breakneck speed. My academic performance plummeted, marking the end of my dependency on others' assistance. My work ethic faltered along the way, potentially jeopardizing my job now. Several suicide attempts have been made by me, yet each time the thought of inflicting pain on my family halts me in my tracks.\n\nEvery day feels more arduous than the last; recently getting arrested for possession of shrooms (deemed a felony where I reside) landed me behind bars for two nights. To prevent matters from escalating further, boosting my grades is imperative; alas, this seems unattainable given the backlog of missed classes and assignments. Conversations concerning my emotions rarely happen as I habitually lie when asked if I am okay or how I feel.\n\nThe mental toll is draining beyond measure; increasingly, death appears to be the sole solution to mend familial bonds — bonds which have seemingly eroded due to problems instigated by yours truly. Ever since relocating onto campus post living with my aunt and uncle's family life has noticeably improved with me absent from the picture.\n\nLately, thoughts have wandered towards researching methods of making my demise seem accidental; however alternatives beyond hotlines remain elusive thus far Uncomfortable with engaging in phone conversations due to anxiety issues; hence venting online serves as a preferred outlet instead.\n\nThank you for taking the time to delve into this Ted talk-like confession — apologies for any grammatical errors or overlooked punctuations among other things.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}

It's disheartening how my drug-induced reveries paint a more vibrant existence than reality ever could, intensifying my desire for release from this defective life I lead. I keenly sense my own inadequacy, as if grappling with an unrecognized terminal condition that leaves me in limbo. Thus, all that remains is a whispered plea for an unknown hand to deliver me from this torment.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

Lacking any motivation, I've woken up to an overwhelming sense of despair and an utter unwillingness to engage in anything. I can't shake the belief that I hold no value in anyone's eyes; I'm not deserving of their time or effort. As a result, I've resigned myself to lying here in silence until, hopefully, some semblance of courage and determination stirs within me. I had everything going for me once, but now it feels like I've single-handedly dismantled it all. They caution against placing your entire existence and reliance on others, yet that's precisely what I've done.\n\nI used to envision a bright future and a fulfilling life ahead with the one I loved dearly - believing that together we could conquer the world. But now, as a consequence of my own actions, the sands of time seem to be slipping away faster than ever. My ongoing cycle of self-sabotage, coupled with battles against depression, anxiety, self-loathing, and rock-bottom self-esteem continuously sabotages any goodness that comes my way - all pointing back to me as the root cause. In my eyes, I've become nothing but a liability; a mere existence taking up space in this world. The loneliness is suffocating - devoid of friends or drive; my only thread connecting me to life is the desire to shield my younger siblings from pain.\n\nEvery direction seems aimless and devoid of purpose; laying in bed engulfed by suffering - whether mental, physical or emotional - seems like the only viable option at this point.

It's a significant revelation as it sheds light on many aspects of my life, even though coming to terms with it initially was tough. I want you to know that I am back in therapy, which offers a glimmer of hope for improvement. It's disconcerting to notice similarities between myself and my abusive uncle in terms of bipolar tendencies, though I am committed to never causing physical harm and instead struggle with the fear of manipulating others, a trait that unsettles me deeply. Despite grappling with feelings of loneliness, confusion about my path, and uncertainties regarding my identity, there has been a slight improvement in my overall well-being compared to before. Embracing and learning to live with myself is becoming more feasible, even if I may not always like what I see. Remember, it's essential to hang onto hope even in the darkest moments. Hitting rock bottom was a necessary step in my journey towards recovery from severe depression and bipolar episodes that led me down a destructive path almost two years ago. These past two years have seen gradual progress, marking a time frame where much has changed yet somehow stayed the same.

Can anyone relate to these emotions? Despite being married, I feel profoundly isolated within my own thoughts. I long for my partner to exhibit the same level of care towards me as I do towards them. It felt like abandonment when they seemed indifferent during my lowest moments of mental distress. Being involved with someone who didn't prioritize my well-being shattered me when I needed support the most. The wounds inflicted on me are beyond repair. Damn polyamory and open relationships for becoming normalized nowadays, intensifying my feelings of detachment not only from friends, family, and everything around me but also from my significant other, who should be there to navigate this pain and provide solace.

Sadly, there's a sense of isolation preventing me from opening up and being truly understood by anyone. And even if I tried articulating my inner turmoil, the words would likely fail me because it feels like there's an infinite void within me, right behind my eyes. Nothing sparks my interest anymore; life lacks meaning. Anger resides within me constantly, fueled by the inability to overcome past traumas and the excruciating pain of nerve damage.

It seems as though I am slowly withering away alone in my apartment. I fear that it might take an extensive period before anyone notices my absence – no one routinely checks up on me; it's always me reaching out to them.\n\nSome years back, outside of a professional context, I confided in a psychologist about my intrusive thoughts and was advised that action becomes a serious concern when plans are set into motion. While I haven't taken definitive steps towards self-harm, the idea haunts me considering how effectively I've distanced myself from those who matter most.

I standby willing to support him in any way necessary – lending an ear, offering advice, providing distractions, or assisting in creating coping mechanisms based on my own struggles with attempting suicide and recalling the emotional turmoil involved that caused me to retreat from it midway due to doubts and regrets.\nHowever, disclosing this information to his somewhat controlling partner (not abusive but highly strung) could potentially backfire and exacerbate the situation rather than remedy it. He had a brief stay in a psychiatric ward once due to severe sleep disturbances which he described as harrowing; thus repeating such an experience would be detrimental.\nHe clings onto the hope of fate offering him a miracle or a purpose while I believe one must forge their own path towards purpose.

I've been merely existing for the past six years, worn out by the monotony of it all. Yearning desperately for a stroke of luck. Emotions seem to elude me now – I want to cry constantly but find myself unable to, and there's no one close enough to confide in and truly comprehend what I'm going through. I can't even grasp my own feelings enough to articulate them properly. It's as if there's an endless void within me, lurking just behind my eyes.

The agony of nerve damage is unbearable. My aspirations have been snatched away from me, leaving behind a profound sense of sorrow, fury, and resentment buried deep in my mind but shrouded by an impenetrable fog. Attempting to confront these emotions only reveals my deteriorating physical state and premature aging before I've had a chance to embrace my youth fully. When will any of this relent?

My sister dismissed my concerns as mere complaints and urged me to focus on practical solutions within my control rather than dwelling on things beyond it.

The thought of painting, reading, or writing fills my mind, surrounded by paints, canvases, paper, and books within reach. Yet, I remain immobile. Sitting before my computer screen with unfinished homework lingers in limbo as I craft essays mentally that never make it onto the page. The notion of obtaining my driver's license has occupied my thoughts for a year now; the Department of Motor Vehicles sits conveniently at the end of my street.

I am left without closure, still puzzled about what led to this sudden departure. Throughout our relationship, she was both physically and emotionally abusive towards me. However, dealing with the shame and emasculation that often comes with admitting that one's female partner is violent at home kept me silent about the abuse. Despite her persistent pleas over the years for me to seek therapy, it was only during the COVID-19 pandemic that I took those steps towards self-improvement and mental well-being. Ironically, she detested the person I was becoming through my efforts to better myself.\n\nNow in my thirties, feeling like a worthless existence with no purpose to continue living, I find myself isolated as she walked away with all our mutual friends. Seeking solace with my family by relocating cross-country only served as a stark reminder of why I prefer distance from them, further exacerbating my already fragile mental state. Strangely enough, I found more happiness being alone with just my dog in my car than in any other setting.\n\nRecently, I've discontinued taking my medications and resorted to heavy drinking—an activity I had successfully avoided for close to a year.

Regrettably, expressing such dark thoughts openly with either my therapist or psychiatrist seems unattainable out of fear of being involuntarily committed. Knowing myself too well, I understand that if pushed into such a situation, I would lie just to evade confinement—ultimately pushing me closer towards contemplating self-harm.\n\nThe bewildering part remains comprehending why those whom I believed loved me could inflict such deep wounds upon me.

Their scripted responses leave me feeling misunderstood and dismissed, leading me to avoid their calls.\n\nI acknowledge that the impact of my actions on loved ones post-tragedy will be immense; however, at this point, living in this manner is unbearable. The isolation in my flat makes me feel like I am slowly withering away into nothingness. The thought crosses my mind that it might take weeks before anyone realizes my absence since nobody routinely checks up on me; usually, it's me reaching out to them.\n\nSome years back during an informal conversation with a psychologist – not in an official capacity but someone I knew personally at the time – about intrusive thoughts and when they become alarming, he mentioned taking action towards a plan should be the red flag. Although no concrete steps have been taken towards self-harm methods like using a rope thus far, the fact that such thoughts have surfaced is unsettling. Alienating those who once mattered to ease the deed has been distressingly easy.\n\nRegarding self-diagnosis: reflecting back on a turbulent childhood marked by violent tendencies towards others and myself through actions like self-harm and bullying behaviors towards siblings and peers leads me to suspect some form of psychosis or schizophrenia alongside bipolar disorder. Is it plausible that hormonal imbalances in blood indicate bipolar disorder while specific tests detect schizophrenia? If these are indeed valid avenues for diagnosis, how can one compel a doctor to conduct these assessments?\n\nIn terms of seeking help: while realizing an online assessment isn't definitive without professional input role holds true, an initial hint or suggestion concerning potential conditions based on disclosed information would be greatly appreciated. Also, insights on medications appropriate for treatment (specifically relevant within the UK) could offer guidance.\n\nMoreover, understanding that altering perspectives is crucial prompts me to inquire about any recommended literature aiding mindset shifts or coping mechanisms comprehension. Thank you sincerely for taking the time to read through this and extend support.\n\nTo individuals experiencing similar sentiments: speaking up truly makes a difference; even engaging with a stranger on a chat hotline can bring solace. And finally, let us all embody kindness without preconceptions – extending warmth and compassion can brighten someone's day unimaginably.\nThank you,\nTom\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

This kind of insensitivity only adds to my distress. The thought of ending my life has been plaguing my mind. I am exhausted and feel utterly lost. Despite seeking help through medication and therapy, it seems like a futile effort. I'm overwhelmed by feelings of failure and worthlessness. It's as if all I amount to is a person burdened with mental health issues, incapable of functioning normally in society. The idea of ceasing to exist crosses my mind frequently, fueled by a difficult past marred by abuse since early childhood. Even with supportive loved ones, like my partner who reassures me that she understands, I can't shake off the belief that maybe they're just trying to placate me with false hope.\n\nMy inner turmoil intensifies as I struggle with the desire to escape this suffering by any means, but at the same time, the guilt and concern for how it would profoundly affect those close to me hold me back. The conflicting emotions surrounding suicidal thoughts torment me daily. Despite yearning for solace through oblivion, the anticipation of the aftermath on others keeps me tethered to this world. It's a constant battle between self-loathing and fear of causing irreparable pain to those who care about me.\n\nReflecting on a tumultuous past marked by abuse and struggles with mental health issues only adds layers of complexity to my already chaotic thoughts. While I find some solace in my partner's presence and support, the inner turmoil persists, leaving me questioning my place in this world and contemplating extreme actions just to ease the burden on others.\n\nThe overwhelming weight of suicidal ideation pushes me towards thoughts of an end where all suffering ceases for myself but triggers immeasurable grief for those left behind.

Battling with depression and anxiety for what feels like an eternity, lacking motivation to work, feeling resentment towards the career path dictated by my family, regretting the poor choices I've made, never experiencing a genuine romantic relationship, devoid of close friendships, lacking any clear ambitions or aspirations. Dealing with a unique eye condition that is not understood by my family, hindering my ability to even drive. Suspicions about having had ADHD since childhood linger – the signs were there then and continue to manifest now. Yet, my family firmly believes mental health issues are fabricated excuses and dismisses problems like depression as mere laziness or immaturity. My brother perceives me as lacking any sense of guilt or shame for being perceived as lazy; little does he know that I am haunted daily by feelings of inadequacy and self-reproach, trapped in my personal hell. I loathe myself for past missteps, my current state, and every action I take because I feel like a failure destined to repel others. Even my supposed \"best friend\" distanced herself upon witnessing my struggles with depression as she prefers happier company. Contemplated drowning, hanging, even jumping from the fourth floor of my residence but faltered each time out of cowardice. Labeling myself as worthless, despicable, and pitifully inadequate feels all too accurate. The question persists – why continue existing and consuming resources better utilized elsewhere?

I always felt like I fell short as a daughter and sibling, despite having now built a better relationship with my father. The trauma and abuse I endured growing up have left deep scars on my mental health, as evidenced by the multitude of diagnoses I've received, which the doctors have termed as a combination of various disorders.\n\nAs a coping mechanism, I retreated into the world of video games to escape the harsh realities of a world that seemed to constantly reject me.

This latest setback may be the last straw, inviting harsh criticism and labeling me as incompetent and lazy. Despite my efforts to avoid being dropped from the course, I am already a week behind on work and had to withdraw from another class due to overwhelming stress.

On top of that, I struggle with a vision impairment that my family doesn't comprehend, making it impossible for me to drive. I suspect I may have had ADHD since childhood, but my family dismisses mental health issues as laziness and immaturity. My brother believes I lack remorse for not being more productive, but in reality, guilt and shame consume me every day. I harbor immense self-loathing for my past actions and current state, feeling like a failure undeserving of anyone's respect. Even my supposed \"best friend\" distanced herself from me when she couldn't handle my depression. I've reached such depths of despair that I've attempted to end my life through drowning, hanging, and jumping from heights – yet each time I couldn't go through with it due to fear. This cycle has left me feeling utterly worthless and questioning why I should continue existing when there may be others more deserving of the resources and space I occupy.

Life itself isn't distasteful to me; rather, it's the current state of my life that weighs heavily on my mind.

All I crave is a semblance of normality in my life. Despite my attempts to seek solace in others, my pain remains misunderstood, leaving me feeling utterly isolated with no sense of anticipation for the future.

{"prompt":"I am currently experiencing overwhelming distress and feelings of hopelessness. Despite having strong thoughts about ending my life, I am apprehensive for reasons I cannot fully understand. Typically, I had envisioned a scenario where all my affairs would be in order before taking such drastic measures – like moving out of my apartment, leaving my job, and securing financial stability for my family. Regrettably, none of these preparations have been made, yet the notion of suicide persists in my mind relentlessly.\n\nOccasionally, I find myself experimenting with the idea by simulating the act of hanging but quickly retract due to dual fears: one, the fear of surviving the attempt and facing potential consequences like being hospitalized; and two, the lack of readiness in terms of practical arrangements. Nonetheless, a deep inner urge compels me to revisit these thoughts incessantly despite my reservations.\n\nThe belief that I am a burden to those around me – my loved ones, colleagues, and even strangers on the internet - amplifies my already overwhelming emotions. The continuous cycle of negative self-perception is proving difficult to break free from as I struggle to find a way out of this mental anguish.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}
{"prompt":"I long for a sense of normalcy, wishing that I had been born without ADHD. Contrary to what was believed, it did not fade away as I entered puberty; in fact, it has only worsened over time. It has transformed me into a perpetually distracted individual who struggles to focus on anything unless it captivates my hyperfixated mind. This condition has alienated me from social interactions and the ability to connect with others in a conventional manner.\n\nReflecting on my past, I acknowledge the validity of the negative perceptions others held of me, as my actions aligned uncomfortably with those viewpoints. Engulfed in obsessions and repetitive behaviors, I found solace in familiar routines and interests. Regrettably, this made me an easy target for relentless bullying during middle school.\n\nEmotionally burdened by feelings of detachment and fear of losing connections with people, I have unintentionally isolated myself by speaking impulsively and causing offense without considering the consequences. The weight of responsibility placed on me by family dynamics only adds to my overwhelming sense of guilt.\n\nDespite being afforded various privileges such as a privileged upbringing and educational opportunities, I feel like I have squandered every advantage presented to me. My academic achievements have not translated into viable prospects for the future, leading to a lackluster career path and subsequent dismissal from a job due to mental health struggles.\n\nLoneliness pervades my existence as I grapple with insecurities about my appearance, social ineptitude, and inability to maintain meaningful relationships. Despite seeking help through therapy and medication, the relief they offer is overshadowed by their limitations in providing genuine solace or joy.\n\nThe longing for normality intensifies as thoughts of ending my life plague my mind with increasing frequency.

{"prompt":"A friend recently expressed concerns about my well-being, suggesting that they believe I may end up taking my own life. I'm feeling quite lost on how to navigate this situation. This conversation took place a few weeks ago, where my friend conveyed their certainty that I will commit suicide, even going as far as saying they would bet on it if given the chance. I was taken aback by these remarks and admitted my uncertainty on how to respond. Initially, I tried to lighten the conversation with humor before mentioning that I am actively working to combat my mental health struggles and swiftly changing the topic. However, ever since that discussion, it has been weighing heavily on my mind and causing me significant distress. The harshness of her words has deeply wounded me, prompting feelings of disbelief in her lack of faith in me. If she was merely concerned about the possibility of me taking such drastic measures, she could have expressed it differently, allowing room for reassurance.\n\nComparing this scenario to a hypothetical one where I was diagnosed with a physical illness like cancer instead of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD), it raises questions on whether she would have been so blunt in predicting my demise and placing bets on it. It seems like a careless and painful statement from her end. This incident has tainted my perception of her, making interactions strained.\n\nShe continues to reach out to hang out (considering we are within the same Covid bubble), leaving me uncertain about how to address this without sparking conflict when expressing my emotions – something those around me aren't accustomed to as they often perceive me as someone who avoids confrontation. I find myself at a crossroads unsure if my feelings of hurt and agitation are justified or if I am blowing things out of proportion.\n\nIn light of this situation, what is the best course of action moving forward?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

I try to stay in touch with them regularly, checking on their well-being and ensuring they are not contemplating any drastic decisions.

As I strive to encourage my friend to persevere, I find myself doubting the validity of my own words.

{"prompt":"I feel like I am deserving of death. Maybe this isn't the right place to share these thoughts. I am not currently making any plans, and I doubt I would even succeed if I tried, yet the overwhelming feeling remains that my existence is not warranted. I recognize myself as a self-absorbed, overly complaining individual who either cannot or does not wish to take the necessary steps to improve my situation. Instead of pursuing ways to better my circumstances, all I seem capable of doing is causing frustration for those who might harbor hopes of seeing me progress. However, deep down, I resist any notion of improvement because in my twisted belief system, I do not merit such progress; instead, a quick end through a bullet to my head seems more fitting. My pattern involves incessant complaining about my loneliness without actually reaching out for companionship and support. Even if by some miracle I did reach out, it is unlikely that it would make any real difference because my mind remains consumed by sorrow, helplessness, and an obsession with my own grievances, leading me to conclude that I have overstayed my welcome as a burden on others for far too long. It is almost cathartic to entertain the thought of someone extinguishing me like the detestable presence that I perceive myself to be. While cognizant of how awful it sounds, I am weary of the efforts of well-meaning strangers who attempt to aid me in finding a path towards improvement – because in my warped perspective, there exists no path or hope for something better; this is simply what I am meant for. Viewing myself as a monstrous being only reinforces the depression that has taken hold of me; in some twisted logic, it feels as though this despair is rightfully mine to bear.

The weight of my pain is overwhelming. The only prospect of happiness seems to lie in the act of ending my own life. Various methods come to mind, but at this point, the means don't seem to matter as long as it accomplishes the end result.\n\nThe idea of plummeting from a bridge into the calming embrace of water now holds a strange appeal. Maybe if I strike my head on a rock on the way down... Morning hits the hardest, awakening serving as a cruel reminder that I'm still trapped in this existence, grappling with internal torment day after day.\n\nDealing with yet another day feels like torture piled upon torture. Will today be the day when it all ends? Heights used to instill fear within me, but now the notion of free-falling from a building seems oddly comforting. A swift collision with concrete head-first – perhaps then it will all be over.\n\nI am acutely aware of how distorted my thoughts have become. To those who know me, I offer my apologies if my behavior has seemed off-kilter. My turmoil runs deeper than you could ever imagine. I'm sorry; all I truly desire is to escape this life once and for all.\n\nPerhaps after work, I'll take a detour leading to my demise - a detour shrouded in finality where no one else needs to bear witness to what unfolds in my mind. Whether by rope or through a fatal car crash, every option carries its own allure.\n\nScouting out potential locations has become somewhat of a macabre routine for me. Death doesn't pick favorites; it treats everyone equally. Alternatively, finding a secluded spot, downing a handful of pills before embarking on one last journey holds its own appeal.\n\nAll that matters is that my intentions are clear and eventually carried out as planned.

Only time will reveal when my moment arrives – each awakening only intensifying the desire for release; regret lingers for not having acted sooner.\n\nThough the sun shines brightly overhead on this beautiful day, to me it feels akin to an invitation for finality – research has led me down dark paths wishing for an easier path towards oblivion; perhaps by simply acquiring cyanide for a peaceful departure.\n\nIf only unconsciousness could precede death through poisoning - rope seems like an inexpensive solution anyway and with various secluded spots nearby, choosing how seems almost like picking from a menu.\n\nThe inclination towards hanging myself supersedes past considerations about other methods – there's almost a strange sense of pride in perfecting such a skill despite prior half-hearted attempts lacking genuine intent.\n\nIn some twisted way, making arrangements feels almost like partaking in one last challenge or competition where victory equates liberation from all future struggles - maybe even emerging triumphant where failure seemed inevitable before…\n\nIt all appears increasingly tempting - disappearing without trace until it's too late for anyone to intervene or save me from myself...no amount of sleep seems capable of lifting this heavy burden that incessantly weighs upon me each time consciousness returns…\n\nHanging myself simply seems like the answer providing solace at long last… grappling with thoughts marred by doubts due to height concerns while searching resolutely for that perfect spot where even gravity won't fail me...\n\nWith unwavering resolve and meticulous planning, finding solace awaits beyond slumber...\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

However, the urge to rationalize ending my life grows stronger each day.

There is a long-distance friend who has been exceptionally compassionate towards me; he does not raise his voice or judge me but rather offers understanding.

I have been contemplating whether or not to disclose the degree to which I have been contemplating making plans for self-harm. I am hesitant about burdening him with all of my emotional baggage - something that I fear is already happening unintentionally. Furthermore, considering there is little he can do practically speaking, I question how sharing this information would change anything.

The societal expectation is for me to exude happiness and gratitude, but all I can muster is a profound sense of melancholy at facing another day where expressing sadness is deemed unacceptable. Birthdays seem more like a way for acquaintances and relatives to congratulate themselves for their acts of remembrance and niceties. It's been about 4 to 5 years, perhaps since I was around 11, since I authentically savored a birthday celebration. True lasting joy has eluded me entirely. Why do others assume all is well with me when in reality, the effort I exert, akin to self-inflicted torture, is solely geared towards securing admission into an Ivy League institution as an escape from my parental environment and this wretched country? Why am I incapable of finding someone who truly comprehends my essence without hesitation? Not the facade I project to the world, but the genuine me. Regrettably, such individuals only exist within the confines of my imagination. I often indulge in fantasies about affection and universal acceptance; constructing an imaginary household offers a fleeting solace until the stark realization that its antithesis prevails hits hard. The ache is unbearable; it occupies a disconcerting middle ground where my tribulations fail to garner significant dismay or sympathy from others yet are grave enough to deeply wound me internally. This predicament torments me. Although there are countless individuals enduring more severe hardships than mine, here I am shedding tears like a fragile being. Why can't I transcend this torment? What predetermined fate sentenced me to navigate this agonizing limbo? My only desire is for survival long enough to find refuge in an illusory realm where physical appearance holds no sway, material desires are fulfilled effortlessly, and moral shortcomings dissolve away.

All my preparations are in place – from the farewell letters to sorting out my affairs.

I recently attempted to engage in artistry, but the outcome was dismal, leaving me drained and disheartened. Creating things used to bring me joy; I relished exploring new ideas and investing time without feeling like it was wasted. However, the ideologies of capitalism and the need for immediate satisfaction have profoundly affected my mindset. This was not how things were supposed to unfold for me.

My fear of being abandoned is overwhelming, yet I also find it hard to connect even when others are willing to open up. Ghosting by people leaves me confused and paranoid as it offers no insights into the situation. Some may interpret ghosting as a quest for casual encounters, but that's not what I seek, and the realization saddens me further. All I yearn for is genuine human connection.\n\nI've engaged in physical intimacy in the past hoping it would prevent someone from leaving easily. This is not a cry for attention, nor do I anticipate any form of rescue; it's just a stark reality check. Simply urging someone not to take drastic measures like ending their life accomplishes very little on its own. Such messages only delay the inevitable help that might never arrive. Labeling someone's struggles as temporary or claiming that circumstances will improve feels cruel when things seem to worsen continuously.\n\nMy inability to navigate life terrifies me, especially when contemplating how to bring about my own demise. The thought of using a shotgun troubles me due to unresolved emotions surrounding my father's passing without a proper send-off. As for handguns, I'm perplexed about whether the caliber size matters significantly if aiming at a specific spot inside my mouth.\n\nExploring other methods brings even greater fears; thoughts of musician Mark Linkous surviving an attempted overdose but ending up paralyzed haunt me. The idea of a failed suicide leaving one permanently incapacitated is truly horrifying. Meanwhile, my body feels like it's slowly succumbing to death every day due to ongoing health issues.\n\nEach morning begins with physical agony, followed by enduring depression and pain throughout most of the day. Evenings are consumed by anxiety about possible nightmares or fears of potential harm from unscrupulous individuals when vulnerability sets in during sleep.\n\nThe harsh reality is that things do not improve over time. If you're hoping for some miraculous intervention, understand that such miracles are rare if at all existent. It may seem like the world we live in thrives on relentless suffering and individuals who exude self-righteous sociopathic tendencies.\n\nConsider putting an end to this seemingly unending cycle now - where survival depends on ruthless competition and enduring agony amidst an indifferent world filled with individuals who revel in their callous disregard for others' well-being.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

The grip of severe depression has been suffocating, a lifelong struggle that has intensified recently. Remorse for my past errors haunts me daily, tainting my self-image with feelings of inadequacy and regret. My emotional instability and anxiety have sabotaged nearly all my relationships, past or potential, leaving me isolated and friendless as I navigate post-college unemployment from the confines of my home. The shame and despair I experience constantly have driven me further into seclusion, perpetuating a vicious cycle of loneliness and internal strife. The battle to push through each day is relentless; every moment feels like a struggle for survival. My family, particularly my mother, worry about me as I retreat deeper into isolation within the confines of my room. Loss of appetite, disrupted sleep patterns, and neglected self-care routines underscore the depth of my internal turmoil. As a Black trans man with a supportive therapist who shares my background, I often question whether recovery is even possible for someone like me. While I lean on her for support regarding various challenges, the shame and fear surrounding my suicidal thoughts prevent me from opening up fully – embarrassed by their presence and anxious about potential consequences if disclosed to a professional who might be mandated to report them. The mere thought of law enforcement intervention exacerbates my distress further, amplifying feelings of hopelessness about life's relentless pain and lack of purpose. Despite efforts to envision a brighter future or extend compassion towards myself, self-love and forgiveness seem unattainable goals shrouded in doubt.

While many aspects of my life have progressed positively, my struggles with suicidal tendencies have repeatedly hindered me, leading to moments where everything falls apart or self-harm attempts set me back. This shadow of despair has become an integral part of my identity over time, once terrifying but now leaving me feeling indifferent and hollow towards life. The depersonalization that accompanies these suicidal thoughts has consumed me for years, stripping away any motivation or desire to continue living. Despite my ability to navigate relationships and perform well in various areas of my life, the effort no longer feels worthwhile. I am drained of energy to maintain a facade of normalcy, engaging with others seems burdensome, emotions are distant, hobbies have lost their appeal, and envisioning any future seems futile. As I grapple with this pervasive misery that has plagued me for as long as I can recall, I feel trapped in this bleak state with no respite in sight.\n\nLiving under someone else's roof following a recent hospitalization has further exacerbated my sense of hopelessness. Financial obligations looming ahead without the means to meet them only add to the despair. It seems like an opportune moment to end it all; however, the fear of physical pain during this final act holds me back. Despite previous attempts at self-harm through hanging that did not render the desired outcome due to failed unconsciousness despite artery compression, the idea persists as an inevitable next step in ending it all. The prospect of earning money from a job interview solely to purchase a weapon intensifies my resolve in this morbid direction.\n\nThe detachment I feel from life due to depersonalization renders suicide as my sole perceived option amidst this overwhelming emptiness. Regardless of external circumstances - whether positive or negative - I remain numb to it all and struggle even with basic interactions due to the perceived burden they bring. The absence of goals or aspirations stems from a pervasive feeling that everything inevitably circles back to the question: why prolong this when ending it is within reach? Depression has been an enduring companion throughout my life but this renewed sense of detachment through depersonalization has robbed me entirely of any desire or volition.\n\nStranded both financially and emotionally, every path forward seems obstructed by insurmountable obstacles leaving me paralyzed by indecision and desperation for release from this relentless anguish that shackles me indefinitely.\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}

Their argument that my actions would bring eternal misery upon them came across as selfish, pressuring me to live solely for their sake. The ensuing blur of heated discussions left me feeling even more desperate, with hurtful remarks driving me towards immediate self-harm fantasies. One person's comment urging me to mature and criticizing my reluctance to open up to them while confiding in a therapist deeply stung.

Despite finally achieving this milestone just a few days ago, granting me what I believed to be the freedom to drive independently and without restrictions, it turns out that I am not allowed to drive anywhere, including to work. My mother, in particular, believes that I am not yet prepared to drive alone and insists that I wait for up to another year due to concerns about car insurance and other reasons that seem unjustified to me.\n\nNot only did my mother doubt my abilities and undermine my confidence leading up to the driving test, but she has now essentially stripped me of the independence that comes with having a driver's license. This situation has greatly disappointed me as it has significantly impacted my plans for the last summer before entering my senior year of high school. While I acknowledge that I may still have areas for improvement as a driver, it is disheartening that my mother holds such a negative perception of my skills behind the wheel.\n\nFurthermore, it is frustrating that despite living just a short distance from my workplace, I am not allowed to use the car even for such short commutes due to her lack of trust in me. After dedicating considerable time and effort practicing for months in anticipation of obtaining my license once again, this turn of events feels like a devastating setback. The desire for increased freedom and the opportunity to share this achievement with friends were among the motivations driving me during this process; unfortunately, it seems that these aspirations have been abruptly taken away from me.\n\nThe current circumstances leave me feeling deeply despondent and overwhelmed with thoughts of self-harm.

{"prompt":"I am currently facing the risk of losing my job, as my boss holds a strong dislike towards me, and I believe I deserve it. At 21, I graduated from college in December. My upbringing with overly zealous evangelical homeschooling parents has left a detrimental impact on me. Despite my efforts to earn a degree and escape my Appalachian hometown to pursue a career in software engineering, my first job significantly altered my role after I had already started, trapping me in a dreadful position. Following that, with my limited networking opportunities from university, I managed to secure another job, but now doubt my ability to secure further employment due to a series of missteps. Recent events include missing an important email, causing delays in HR procedures by procrastinating on signing necessary documents, and just today being assigned to a QA team instead of software development. Out of concern for repeating past mistakes, I reluctantly accepted the new assignment only to face severe criticism from my boss who expressed disdain for me and pointed out all the errors I've made thus far (which is true). This occurred just hours ago; although I have extended an apology and established good rapport with my new team, apprehension still lingers. The fear of not being able to find another job looms over me; failure would result in financial instability and the inability to afford rent. Since relocating to a new city, I haven't had the opportunity to build friendships or engage in dating for years (I am not very confident in my appearance but oddly enough it doesn't bother me much). My family dynamics are complex and have deprived me of a normal childhood experience; consequently, every attempt at progress seems to lead me into deeper despair instead of liberation from past constraints.

The world would probably be better off without me. The weight of failing senior year is a stark reminder of my shortcomings. Despite knowing the toxicity of my family's affections, the longing for love and acceptance persists. Sometimes I wonder why I wasn't just aborted. Anticipating a solitary death marred by neglect until bills accumulate haunts me - possibly remaining undiscovered for an extended period in a cold and lonely departure from this world.

{"prompt":"Reasons for my decision to end everything are numerous. I find myself overwhelmed with the desire to shut down mentally, consumed by thoughts of putting an end to it all. The burden of living with epilepsy, constant headaches, paranoia, relentless overthinking, sleepless nights, body dysmorphia, anorexia, and a melancholic mind has been unbearable. The reckless behavior, brain fog, and inability to focus on daily tasks have added to my distress for as long as I can remember.\n\nReflecting on my childhood brings memories of not fitting the conventional mold. Dealing with selective mutism and being lost in my own thoughts led me to develop a rich inner life filled with monologues and vivid imagination. While other kids played outside, I preferred immersing myself in my grandfather's books. School was a place where I felt invisible despite teachers acknowledging my abilities; mentally, I was detached from that environment and its rigid educational system.\n\nMy upbringing in a conservative family that dismissed anything outside their narrow views pushed me towards my more open-minded grandfather. Feeling neglected at home compared to my extroverted sister and underserved due to the special care required by my youngest sister who suffered from a rare condition created a sense of isolation early on. The lack of social skills development further alienated me, leading to profound feelings of loneliness.\n\nThe prolonged silence I maintained for nearly fifteen years provided a sense of safety but also deepened my internal turmoil. Traumatic events like the car crash where I was left unattended after being harmed or incidents at school where no one intervened fueled my sense of abandonment and isolation further. The lack of support during bullying episodes took a toll on my mental and physical well-being.\n\nThe loss of my grandfather, who was my main source of strength amidst turmoil, devastated me further and accentuated feelings of abandonment. Missed opportunities like studying engineering in Malaysia on scholarship due to familial restrictions intensified the despair and sense of failure that overshadowed every aspect of my life.\n\nFallout from using painkillers and antidepressants illicitly escalated into substance addiction and deteriorated both physical health and mental state drastically. Feeling like an utter failure compounded by losing all friends deepened the sense of worthlessness that pervaded every aspect of existence.\n\nIn moments where life feels like an endless cycle of breakdowns filled with unfairness and despair, the question arises about finding relief - yet deep down lies a clinging hope for validation or acceptance despite overwhelming self-perceived failures.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}
{"prompt":"I am overwhelmed with worry about what lies ahead. It's a real struggle just to motivate myself to prepare for exams without breaking down in tears. My mental well-being has taken a severe hit during this academic year. Apart from occasional conversations with my parents, I've only interacted with one other person. I have a pile of unfinished assignments, and it's a miracle I'm barely scraping by with a C- in my toughest subjects. The realization that I won't be able to submit the missed assignments as per the syllabus hits hard, especially since it clearly states no late submissions after our last test. The looming AP Biology exam on Thursday adds to my stress—due to my lack of attention all semester, my current grade is solely propped up by using Quizlet during tests. The thought of continuing feels unbearable. I know it's just a matter of enduring for another two weeks until it all ends. But those weeks seem insurmountable right now. Just recently, after an emotionally draining preparation for my other AP exam last Thursday which involved intense studying and tearful nights, suicide has unexpectedly crossed my mind—a thought that never occurred to me throughout the year and beyond. Honestly, if it weren't for my parents, I wouldn't care at all. Their silent but palpable expectations of greatness weigh heavily on me; they recognize my intelligence, as do I, but they are unaware of the turbulence in my mind over time. With age creeping up on me, discussions about the future from my parents grow more frequent—college choices, majors, career paths—all questions to which I have no answers yet. And let me make it clear—I am lost and confused about these weighty matters that have never crossed my mind before as I've been solely dedicated to finding daily happiness ever since quarantine began. My 'friends' have deserted me, leaving me stranded without any familiar emotional anchors to cling to for solace; even activities that once brought me joy now serve no purpose in alleviating this profound sense of emptiness within me. It feels like everything that used to support me emotionally is crumbling away when I need them most. Where do I turn from here? At fifteen years old, unloading all these bottled-up issues here makes me feel pathetic; reading others' accounts of real struggles only accentuates this feeling of insignificance within me. After all, we all face mortality someday—so why should any of this matter? Why should I even care anymore? Who else has found themselves devoid of tears?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

The process of divulging nearly all of my struggles to them was utterly mortifying and humiliating, leaving me with an urge to scream in frustration. Although I dread living under the same roof as them, it seemed like the only option besides contemplating suicide. The mere thought of what they now know makes me physically ill. There was a moment when I was on the brink of taking drastic measures, but out of desperation, I poured my heart out to my mom through a text. And here I am today, making arrangements to leave college and return home. The prospect fills me with dread because truthfully, living with my family is something I detest. I fear regretting this decision and sometimes wish for an easy way out.\n\nHaving opened up to my family has left me feeling trapped in discomfort. My mental instability has driven me back to my parents' house as living alone is no longer an option for me. Baring all of my struggles to them was excruciatingly embarrassing; it made me want to tear my hair out. Despite my reluctance to reside with them again, it seemed like the only alternative to attempting suicide. The idea of them knowing the extent of my challenges churns my stomach with unease.\n\nTonight, I found myself on the edge of consuming a handful of pills knowing well that it wouldn't be fatal. The temptation was strong, but so was the realization that this cycle is unsustainable. Failing every class due to a lack of attendance has pushed me into a corner where responsibilities are piling up and yet getting out of bed feels like an insurmountable task.\n\nMy mind flirts with thoughts of overdosing just enough to warrant hospitalization — not as a suicide attempt but as a cry for help that even feels irrational at this point. Confusion clouds my judgment as considering various options leaves me feeling trapped between two undesirable outcomes — revealing more than I wish or struggling silently until breaking point.\n\nThe day has been spent eyeing pill bottles knowing that they contain nowhere near what'd be necessary for a fatal overdose, yet pondering taking enough for hospital admission persists as an option on the table. Urgent help is what's required now; pretending that everything is okay is no longer sustainable.\n\nThe depths of despair have become so profound that day-to-day functioning seems impossible without serious intervention and support from loved ones who remain unaware of the severity of my struggles.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

Coupled with what I perceive as limitations in my intelligence, I see no path to success or fulfillment. While I have the means to survive, I lack the desire to do so. Happiness eludes me, and it's hard to envision a time when things will improve. Despite having loved ones around me, I struggle with the belief that they would ultimately manage without me, especially since my mother has other children to live for. At just 18 years old, it already feels like I've hit rock bottom, with all my hopes and dreams dashed by an overwhelming sense of despair. The concept of living no longer holds any significance for me; it feels like my spirit has been extinguished by hopelessness.

My mother believes I am not ready for solo driving and insists that I wait for up to a year due to car insurance reasons.

The idea that my body, my choice should extend to the right to end my own life feels like it's being cruelly denied by a system that insists I must keep on living in this miserable state. It's infuriating. What's even worse is how this feeling seems to spread like a virus, infecting those around me.

The current state of society, influenced by social conventions and the dynamics of platforms like Tinder, has made it increasingly challenging for men considered below average to find happiness. I harbor resentment towards women for the way they have treated me - constant rejection or relegation to the friend zone. It's become too much to bear. The world disgusts me, and all I can do is drown my sorrows in alcohol as I am doing now. This existence is unbearable. My interactions with women have only ever led to feelings of rejection or being labeled as \"just a friend\". Their privileges in society infuriate me.

Lately, I've been enduring a terrible wave of physical symptoms – a sore throat, potential fever, and now a cough. Alongside these ailments, I've been experiencing a deep sense of isolation. My father's frustrations with me are escalating over minor issues, while my friends seem indifferent to my struggles. Feeling utterly drained and desperate for support, I find myself with no one to turn to. Trapped in my own thoughts and compounded by illness, I am grappling with a profound sense of not belonging. All I have ever craved is the feeling of being cared for, a beacon of hope to cling onto, offering me a reason to persevere. Yet, instead of solace or connection, all I encounter is emptiness. My mind is so tumultuous that addressing even a fraction of its turmoil overwhelms me; compounding this is the impending news on my test results. Should they be negative, I contemplate fleeing – leaving everything behind to face whatever fate awaits me without concern. Conversely, if the test reveals a positive result, suicide seems like the only path forward. Fear once restrained me from this ultimate act but no longer does; now, any method that promises escape from another day holds an appeal that outweighs any reservations. Admittedly aware of the selfishness and irrationality of these contemplations, my desire remains simple: the ability to make one decision solely for myself amidst this chaos and neglect. The thin thread tethering me to life feels near its breaking point; maintaining it seems increasingly futile as each moment passes.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

Despite my efforts to prove myself, her lack of trust and negative attitude have left me feeling defeated and robbed of a significant milestone in my high school journey. The constant criticism and limitations imposed on me have become unbearable, making me question the worth of continuing like this.

Your father's happiness shouldn't be linked to your absence. I acknowledge your battles with depression but constantly using it as a shield might not be helpful.\" Again from mom, \"It's important for me to communicate with you. I urge you to engage rather than withdraw further into despair.\"\n\nAs for my dad's perspective, \"I've noticed you declining invitations to spend time with me and my girlfriend. It feels like you're isolating yourself more than being left alone intentionally.\" He also expressed, \"In case of any past attempts at harming yourself - regardless of their intent - please seek help and remember that there are better ways to cope with pain.\"\n\nMoreover, he stated, \"Recurring incidents of food restriction are concerning me. It seems like a cycle that needs attention.

{"prompt":"A plea for assistance. It's been a full month since my partner, with whom I spent a decade, unexpectedly left me on my birthday. They packed their bags and simply announced their departure. The lack of closure is agonizing, as I remain clueless about what transpired. Despite enduring physical and emotional abuse from her, I harbored the silence of emasculation rather than disclosing it to anyone. It's a daunting task to confess that my female partner resorts to violence during heated exchanges at home. She had persistently urged me to undergo therapy over the years and eventually took the first steps during the COVID-19 pandemic. I dedicated myself to personal growth and mental well-being, which she seemed to resent. Now in my thirties, I feel like a lost cause with no purpose left in life. She departed, taking all our mutual friends with her, leaving me utterly alone. A temporary visit to family across the country only exacerbated my mental health struggles, prompting me to realize why I had distanced myself from them in the first place. Ironically, solitude with just my dog in my car felt more comforting than any other company or destination.\n\nI've ceased taking my prescribed medication and resorted to heavy drinking—a habit I had managed to break for nearly a year. Today marked the consumption of my final Ativan pill, the only thing preventing me from spiraling into despair. Anticipating reluctance from my psychiatrist to renew the prescription intensifies my sense of hopelessness. Perhaps for some individuals, suicide serves as their inevitable fate—strangely enough, I find myself slowly embracing this notion. Unfortunately, expressing such thoughts openly with either my therapist or psychiatrist is out of the question due to fear of mandatory institutionalization.\n\nIt baffles me why those whom I believed cared for me deeply would inflict such profound pain upon me. A belief in unfavorable karma haunts me—I almost feel deserving of this suffering as if nature dictates that it's time for me to succumb.

Hiding my scars under a dress, but deep down, I know they're aware of what's going on, they just choose not to acknowledge it. It's disheartening to realize that I don't belong anywhere and that maybe I'm just selfish. Hearing people telling me I'm destroying myself only adds to the pain and isolation I feel. You can't save everyone in this world, it's a harsh reality that weighs heavily on me. Despite not wanting others to self-harm, I find myself resorting to it repeatedly.

The constant onslaught of flashbacks, panic attacks, nightmares, disrupted eating and sleeping patterns has been relentless for an extended period. \n\nI acknowledge that my actions towards my abusive ex are unacceptable – despite trying to distance myself from them, I find myself unable to stop stalking and harassing them.

The reality of the situation is daunting, you might be experiencing depression, feeling lacking in skills that others would find valuable, possibly not affiliated with any religious beliefs. Maybe you catch yourself fantasizing about how having a partner would change things. Your relationship with your parents might not have been ideal; they could have been either distant or overly smothering. You may have entertained thoughts of turning to substances like drugs or alcohol to ease the burden. However, deep down, you are afraid of these thoughts and tendencies – suicidal thoughts serve as a means of coping, merely serving as distractions and fostering a false sense of detachment from reality. It's crucial to recognize that despite your struggles, you lack the courage to follow through on these impulses; acknowledge this and find solace in the idea that even contemplating such actions showcases a reluctance rather than true intent. Self-loathing seems commonplace, and even those who claim not to harbor self-hatred likely maintain an indifference toward themselves in a prolonging manner akin to using sedatives to avoid self-reflection.\n\nShould you entertain the idea further and feel inclined towards taking drastic measures, don't hide it quietly. If you feel compelled towards such extreme actions, do it boldly rather than fading into obscurity. Assert your presence with vigor and make a loud statement if need be; shift the blame from yourself onto an unjust world if that aids your perspective. While the suggestion of causing havoc using extension ladders and wire cutters might seem darkly humorous, learning how to create explosives like nitroglycerin at home through online resources is unsettling but feasible – take heed that this is not a path one should tread upon lightly or alone.

I lack any motivation or enthusiasm for anything anymore. The goals I once had no longer spark any excitement within me, and the idea of setting new ones doesn't resonate either.\n\nEven my favorite meals fail to evoke any pleasure; in fact, if I can even decide on one, it all tastes bland and monotonous to me. I eat out of necessity to avoid feeling light-headed. The mere thought of getting up from bed each day and going through the motions of life feels like an insurmountable task.\n\nDespite investing significant amounts of money into my mental well-being, there seems to be a glimmer of hope for recovery on the horizon — but what am I striving for? Even without the shadow of illness hanging over me, there's a profound lack of desire or enjoyment in anything.

{"prompt":"At 18 years old, I find it hard to express my thoughts. Over time, I've resorted to self-harm as a way to shift emotional pain to physical pain, resulting in a multitude of scars covering my entire body. This numbness has plagued me since the age of 12. Following my discharge from the military on psychological grounds, I was referred to a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with sociopathy and self-injury. Lately, thoughts of suicide have lingered as I find no pleasure in life, lack affection for others, engage in habitual lying, and inflict pain on people without cause. Although engaged to a woman who deeply cares for me but whom I find bothersome, my recent reconnection with an ex-girlfriend has stirred new emotions within me. She has undergone traumatic experiences such as repeated rape and battles depression. After spending a night together, my usual numbness lifted, and I experienced genuine happiness for the first time. However, upon her unsuccessful suicide attempt following our meeting and subsequent institutionalization, I am left with uncertainty about her well-being and our future together. We agreed that if she decides to end her life, we would do it together; consequently, contemplating my existence without her now feels unbearable, leading me to consider ending everything.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

Despite my parents' efforts to intervene and prevent it, the truth is I feel like I could act on it at any moment.

{"prompt":"I've found myself completely isolated. A recent altercation led to the loss of all my friends, who labeled me as self-centered and careless before cutting ties with me. My struggles with anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder have deeply affected my mother, exacerbating her own feelings of despondency. This has caused my father and sister to harbor resentment towards me for causing her distress. I'm engulfed in a sense of emptiness and solitude, feeling utterly misunderstood. Despite attempting therapy, I've been unable to open up about the overwhelming pain that consumes me. Self-loathing consumes me as I believe I only bring trouble and misery into the lives of those around me. The weight of my existence has become unbearable, pushing me to the brink where ending it all seems like the only escape. Fear holds me back from taking that final step, imagining the consequences of failure being even more agonizing than my current torment. While the idea of causing sadness lingers if I were to disappear, deep down I convince myself that everyone would ultimately be better off without the burden of caring for me. The conviction that I don't fit in and that nothingness is preferable entwines with a desperate hope that there must be something better awaiting beyond this suffering. The outlook appears bleak, with a future seemingly filled only with further blunders and destruction.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}
{"prompt":"The anger I felt yesterday has subsided, but my persistent thoughts of ending my life have not diminished. I find myself contemplating what purpose there is in continuing to exist when any shred of motivation I manage to hold onto is either snatched away or dangled tantalizingly close, only to be cruelly out of reach, almost mocking me, or ruthlessly obliterated before my eyes. Despite putting forth every ounce of effort over these recent weeks to simply stay afloat, it seems to have all been in vain. These past weeks have perhaps been the most formidable battle I've faced, yet the repercussions seem to strike even more severely. Why persevere? Why make the attempt when it only seems to exacerbate matters and drain your vitality in the process? The two suicide attempts I made in the last fortnight and three times in the past half-year somehow pale in comparison to the torment I've endured recently. So then, what is the point? Why bother struggling further when it only results in further deterioration? The act of taking my own life may indeed be excruciating, but is it truly more agonizing than what I have withstood thus far? I'm beginning to doubt that. Even if there is a supposed \"light at the end of the tunnel,\" it no longer holds any significance for me. All I desire now is an escape from this tunnel, and if that escape must come through a collision with an oncoming train, then that is a path I would willingly choose at this\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}

It's not something I actively plan, it's more like background noise during a journey. Recently, I've been struggling with the difficulty of finding a way to end things peacefully. The idea of being stuck in a hospital or psychiatric ward, fighting to survive against my will, is my worst nightmare. To ease my discomfort last night, I took a couple of Ambiens and drifted into a dream where I fashioned the perfect noose and eventually succumbed after a 15-minute struggle. When I woke up, I felt disoriented and struggled to catch my breath. Financial constraints are preventing me from seeking therapy at the moment. There's potential for some extra money next month which I hope will allow me to resume therapy, although lately, it doesn't seem as effective as before. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to keep up with journaling or tracking my thoughts.

Spare me your depression excuses, I've had enough of that.\" Another time she exclaimed, \"I'm talking to you! Answer me! Why haven't you just shot yourself already?\"\n\nMy father, on the other hand, often expressed sentiments like, \"I always try to include you in plans with my girlfriend, but you always refuse. It's not me abandoning you; it's you isolating yourself. You are the root of the issue.\" He also callously remarked, \"Oh, did you attempt suicide again? Go ahead then; we both know you lack the courage to go through with it.\"\n\nMoreover, my father scolded me for vomiting after meals by saying, \"Stop wasting my money on food if you're just going to throw it up. I won't be buying meals for you anymore.\" In another instance he callously mentioned how he hadn't even noticed my presence during a gathering with his girlfriend's family.\n\nWhenever I was upset or crying, my father would mockingly ask if I was planning to harm myself again and dismiss my emotions as mere attention-seeking behavior. He even went as far as suggesting that an iPhone could somehow magically cure my struggles with depression.\n\nIn a particularly hurtful conversation with my dad where I questioned his treatment towards me given his hurtful words and actions towards me for a long time now.

I've been dealing with a persistent sore throat, what seems like a fever, and now a cough. On top of that physical discomfort, I also feel deeply disconnected from everyone around me. My father's constant anger over trivial matters and my friends' apparent indifference have amplified this sense of isolation. I am utterly drained and desperate to reach out for support, but it feels like there is no one around who truly cares. I find myself trapped in my own thoughts, worsened by my current illness.\n\nThroughout my life, all I have ever yearned for is a sense of belonging, yet I have never quite found where I fit in.

Unfortunately, this desire remains unfulfilled, leaving me with overwhelming emptiness inside.\n\nMy mind is cluttered with myriad thoughts that seem insurmountable to even approach or address. However, it seems that everything now hinges on the outcome of my COVID test. Should it be negative, my plan is to distance myself from everyone and everything – whatever fate awaits me thereafter holds little significance. In the case of a positive result, suicide becomes a consideration. Fear of death once restrained me from such thoughts but not anymore; any means to end the suffering seems justifiable at this point.\n\nI acknowledge that these sentiments may come across as self-centered and unreasonable; nevertheless, at this juncture, all I desire is to make one decision solely for myself regardless of its selfish nature.

The burden of living with epilepsy, accompanied by headaches, paranoia, overthinking, and incessant sleepless nights is unbearable. Dealing with body dysmorphia, anorexia, a melancholic mind, reckless behavior, brain fog, and the inability to focus on everyday tasks only adds to the strain. Reflecting on my childhood brings to mind my struggles with selective mutism and the tendency to retreat into my inner world. I possessed a rich imagination and often found solace in reading my grandfather's books while other children played outside. School was a place where I felt like a wallflower, unseen by many despite being recognized for my abilities. However, I never truly felt mentally present in that environment due to a disconnect with traditional learning methods.\n\nThe roots of my challenges trace back to familial dynamics shaped by conservative beliefs that clashed with my more open-minded grandfather's influence.

Instances of bullying at school intensified the mental and physical toll I endured without any support systems in place. Negative self-talk became pervasive as stress mounted and eventually manifested into diagnosed epilepsy.\n\nThe guiding light in this darkness was my late grandfather; his passing deepened feelings of abandonment that plagued me. Dreams deferred like an opportunity to study engineering on scholarship were dashed by familial opposition based on outdated gender norms. Coping mechanisms took destructive forms through painkillers and antidepressants that spiraled into harmful addiction patterns.\n\nAs I grapple with failure upon failure, self-sabotage consumes any semblance of hope or progress. The constant barrage of life's unfairness pushes me to the brink where ending it all seems like the only respite from this relentless suffering.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

{"prompt":"My sense of stability has been completely shattered. Just recently, I was unexpectedly let go from my remote, lucrative job with low stress and flexible hours. This job was my anchor in life. I live alone due to escaping from an abusive ex-partner, leaving me without anyone to lean on financially until I secure a new job. My mom, who also lost her job, is unable to assist me, and out of pride, I hesitate to confide in my dad about my job loss. Additionally, I am currently enrolled in school, a situation that may now need to be reconsidered. The comfort and security I had meticulously built for myself vanished in a brief Zoom call.\n\nFinding a comparable job seems daunting as my previous role was highly specialized within the company and not easily transferable elsewhere. The skills I gained are not widely applicable in other positions. Achieving financial independence was a significant milestone for me amidst the turmoil of my life experiences. It provided a semblance of contentment about who I am. However, it now appears that maybe my ex's hurtful words about me being worthless and unattractive were indeed true.\n\nI feel like that progress has been snatched away from me abruptly without any promise of return in the foreseeable future. Life seems like an endless cycle of hardships with fleeting moments of joy promptly yanked away when attained. At 27 years old without a degree, partner, or employment, it's becoming increasingly challenging to find motivation to persist.\n\nFrom a young age, I harbored suspicions that existence itself was an intricate lie designed to deceive us all. However, fear and concern for others held me back from acting on these thoughts before. Yet at this moment, those inhibitions seem to have dissipated entirely.\n\nStruggling against overwhelming odds only to face continuous adversity makes existence feel like an unbearable burden with no respite in sight.\n\nThe idea of driving away into the wilderness and finding solace through nature's embrace is gradually becoming more appealing as an escape from this unending torment - where peace might finally be attainable.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

What's even more distressing is the profound sense of guilt for even experiencing these emotions, as outwardly, things appear to be in order. Solid relationships with family, a stable job, and financial security should ostensibly equate to contentment. Yet, the clamor within me persists. My disdain for my own body is a significant source of despair; grappling with being overweight has always plagued me with self-consciousness. Despite embarking on a weight loss journey, my dissatisfaction with my physical appearance remains unshakeable. The dysphoria stemming from being a transgender man further amplifies this self-loathing. Though two years into testosterone therapy, the societal perception continues to label me as female, and my reluctance to correct others only deepens the internal turmoil. The intersection of weight issues and gender dysphoria fuels a vicious cycle of self-deprecation.\n\nCompounding these struggles is my complex sexuality – being attracted to men while also identifying as potentially asexual perplexes me. The fear of being undesirable looms large; past experiences hint that being transgender played a role in previous relationship failures, underscoring feelings of inadequacy in my masculinity. My non-conformity to traditional gender roles coupled with disinterest in physical intimacy paint a lonely picture on the romantic front.\n\nThough I don't harbor genuine intentions of ending my life, I can't shake the belief that those around me would fare better without having to bear witness to my constant inner turmoil or navigating the complexities of embracing a transgender individual in their midst.

My life has been fraught with recklessness, brain fog, and an inability to focus on mundane tasks. This plight traces back to my unconventional childhood marked by selective mutism and introspective tendencies that isolated me within my own thoughts. Growing up in a conservative household where I felt neglected compared to my extroverted sister and mentally challenged youngest sibling left me feeling invisible and devoid of guidance. The absence of support at home was exacerbated by traumatic incidents like the car crash with my father where my injuries were trivialized while nightmares haunted me thereafter. The physical and mental abuse endured at the hands of bullies further deteriorated my mental well-being without any solace from either family or school authorities. Subsequently, I began grappling with epilepsy triggered by stress and past trauma that led to hospitalizations and ongoing battles with negative voices in my head.\nThe loss of my supportive grandfather intensified feelings of abandonment that have long plagued me, pushing me towards isolation in fear of being hurt again. Rejection of cherished dreams like studying engineering abroad due to familial restrictions inflicted a deep wound compounded by the subsequent struggles with depression and addiction to alleviate the pain through painkillers and antidepressants. This destructive cycle culminated in severe damage to my health – both physically and mentally – leaving me desolate, friendless, feeling like an utter failure who is undeserving of any semblance of happiness or success.

We've become slaves to routines and habits, and I believe any fiction turned reality should be dismantled because of its dangerous influence on people – this applies to music as well. It's baffling how we've let fiction take such control over our lives, including things like money. I don't see the point in living anymore – someone please end it for me.\"\n\n\"Why is it so difficult to find a way out? I'm detached from life entirely. It feels like we're all part of a twisted experiment where the horrors of history continue endlessly, reducing us all to mere numbers in a cruel game. I long for an escape from my family and this existence – I no longer care about causing them any distress or disappearing without a trace. As a man, I feel dispensable and just want to fade away into nothingness. The idea of having children is repulsive to me; there are far too many individuals on this planet already.\"\n\n\"I'm desperate to know the quickest route to death as I can't bear living on.

How tragic that we've allowed ourselves to be enslaved by mere constructs like music\/technology\/money\/government\/corporations\/society\/the establishment.

Being born male feels like an oversight rooted in short-sighted decisions made by my family and myself that now bind me here with no drive left within me.

{"prompt":"The most overlooked ways to assist a struggling friend are actually quite simple. When someone we care about is going through a difficult time and contemplating suicide, the initial impulse is usually to try and solve their problems. Encouraging a friend to seek help from a specialist, such as a psychiatrist, can be tremendously beneficial, there is no denying that; however, before delving too deeply into analyzing the situation, it's important to remember two small gestures that can make a significant difference: - embraces. Yes, physical hugs can go a long way. Ask someone when was the last time they received a heartfelt hug; chances are they won't recall. And offering a hug to someone in need of comfort is always appreciated. - emotional support. Not interrogations or advice, but unwavering support.

Since returning to my home country, Romania, two years ago, I have been overwhelmed by stress, primarily stemming from school. In 2019, I felt isolated without many friends, leading me to cry myself to sleep most weeks. Even activities I once enjoyed lost their appeal. Thoughts of suicide crossed my mind numerous times, but the love I have for my little brother prevented me from acting on those dark impulses. During the pandemic, things slightly improved; despite battling persistent anxiety, having a friend who listened and supported me made a significant difference. However, the current situation has taken a harsh turn for the worse. Overwhelmed by stress and anxiety that paralyze me, I find myself lacking motivation to pursue anything. Additionally, last year I came to terms with identifying as both atheistic and bisexual. My family holds strong religious beliefs as do my friends; confiding in my only friend about this recently has caused a strain in our relationship as he grows distant. He was my sole confidant and the person I could rely on for regular conversation. These emotions are festering inside me, and the fear of being dismissed with phrases like \"it's just a phase\" or \"you're too young to be stressed about such things\" has left me feeling trapped.

The plan is to then drive to a bridge or freeway overpass. Additionally, I am contemplating purchasing a gun soon. These are merely short-term fixes for what feels like insurmountable permanent issues. I find no pleasure in living and have no desire to continue doing so. It would mean a lot if people could understand and respect my perspective.\n\nThe lack of any strong passion or motivation to keep going is overwhelming. Not only do I feel inadequate in everything I attempt, but I also lack the enthusiasm to engage with the world around me. The concept of exploring new avenues or gaining knowledge holds no significance for me whatsoever.\n\nTo compound matters, it seems that nobody is interested in connecting with me either. As someone dealing with Asperger's, my social ineptitude renders me incapable of forming friendships or meaningful relationships, and this seems unlikely to change as time goes on. The thought of enduring the process of attempting to forge connections is more unbearable than the idea of ending my own life. Consequently, no amount of persuasion can dissuade me from this mindset.\n\nThe prospect of waiting several decades just to establish a casual acquaintance seems utterly futile - in such circumstances, leaping off a bridge appears preferable. I staunchly believe in the right to choose when and how one wishes to depart from this world; prolonging my existence against my will only delays the inevitable truth that life's meaning is nothing but an illusion which many fail to recognize.\"\n\n\"If you're considering reaching out to the suicide hotline, I would advise against it based on personal experiences.

Their approach typically involves allowing you to express your feelings before offering cliched advice such as 'do something you love' or commendations on your strength for enduring such turmoil for an extended period. Furthermore, the time constraints imposed during these interactions are glaringly apparent; after approximately thirty minutes, their eagerness to conclude the conversation becomes evident.\n\nMoreover, individuals harboring suicidal thoughts must tread carefully during these conversations to avoid being involuntarily taken into psychiatric care; even innocuous queries about your safety may trigger unwarranted interventions leading towards hospitalization.\"\n\n\"At present, I do not possess a solid plan for taking my own life; all I yearn for is someone understanding whom I can converse with regarding the persistent negative thoughts plaguing my mind. These ruminations predominantly focus on self-deprecation and hopelessness. Though driving to a nearby bridge and ending it all may seem like an appealing notion, lacking a driver's license serves as an obstacle necessitating patience.\"\n\n\"Once I obtain my license, my intention is clear - driving straight towards the tallest bridge in my area and jumping off it without hesitation. While currently without a concrete method to execute this plan immediately, acquiring one within the next few months seems feasible given upcoming events leading towards obtaining said license.\n\nThe idea of pilfering my parents' car after attaining licensure and embarking on an hour-long journey towards that bridge fills me with an odd sense of relief - be it by drowning or instantaneous impact upon landing below its structure. Undaunted by notions of pain or discomfort associated with such acts,I seek only closure through their completion.\n\nNonetheless, until that pivotal moment arrives,I find little solace in existence as life holds no appeal for me,I remain unmoved by any reassurances therapists might offer,and unequivocally believe there exists no purpose worth living for,perspectives concerning life's meaning are inherently subjective,and ultimately,cannot alter this fundamental truth.\"\n\n\"I am engulfed by profound darkness within myself yearning for an end so definitive that gut-wrenching takes on a literal meaning.I dread each passing day spent above ground,wishing fervently instead for eternal rest beneath it.My mornings begin plagued by relentless regret,and even in slumber,I meet demise rather than dreams.Thoughts brim with negativity throughout every waking hour...\n\nAmidst fleeting moments of joy lies nothing substantial enough to fend off despair long-term.I harbor an aversion towards enduring anything over extended periods,having developed an intense loathing towards existence itself.Perhaps,somewhere along life's path,I have deviated onto a course ill-fitting -at least,this is what resonates within.\"\n\n\"I am urgently seeking solace,coveting conversation above all else.Yet,languishing inarticulacy encumbers me,relegating me into utter disarray devoid of companionship or intimate connections.This turmoil simmers silently within like water nearing its boiling point,making every moment fraught with tension while feeling profoundly disconnected from life at large.\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

It's not something I actively plan, more like background noise during a drive. Recently, the difficulty of successfully ending one's life has been weighing heavily on me. The last thing I want is to be confined in a hospital or a psych ward, fighting to stay alive against my will. Last night, feeling unwell, I took a couple of Ambiens and ended up dreaming about creating and succumbing to the perfect hangman's noose after a 15-minute struggle. I woke up feeling disoriented and struggling to catch my breath. Financial constraints make affording therapy impossible right now. I have some bonus money coming next month which may allow me to resume therapy, although I'm doubtful about its effectiveness now. Keeping track of my thoughts or journaling has become challenging.

My academic performance has taken a hit, and they are seething with anger, labeling me as a failure and a source of disappointment. I attempted to open up to them about my feelings of cowardice and contemplation of drastic measures, but it fell on deaf ears. All that seems to matter to them are grades and household chores.

Their words cut deep, and I endured nights of tearful sleep in her embrace. While confiding in a friend about what was happening, instead of offering solace or guidance, he callously proclaimed that I must be lying about self-harming and accused me of being fake – his message was shared among others who proceeded to goad my girlfriend into harming herself.

The burdens of living with epilepsy - the constant headaches, paranoia, overthinking - coupled with body dysmorphia, anorexia, and a mind shrouded in melancholy, make every passing day unbearable. My inability to grasp a full night's sleep for what feels like eternity only amplifies the weight I carry. Recollections of my troubled childhood haunt me; from battling selective mutism to feeling disconnected within my own thoughts, it seems like a lifetime ago when I found solace in my grandfather's books instead of partaking in typical childhood activities. School was never a sanctuary either; navigating through its rigid structures felt suffocating as I struggled to fit in among the masses, always feeling invisible within the academic paradigm.\n\nHome, the supposed haven, lacked the warmth and understanding I yearned for; overshadowed by an extroverted sister and overlooked due to a mentally ill sibling who demanded more attention, I was left to navigate my emotions alone. The absence of guidance and support further isolated me, paving the way for perpetual feelings of loneliness and abandonment that continue to linger. The silence that enveloped me for years became both a shield and a tormentor, shielding me from external chaos while suffocating me in its grip.\n\nTraumatic incidents etched deep scars in my psyche; from being disregarded after an accident to experiencing neglect and abuse at school without any semblance of intervention or solace. The voices of self-doubt grew louder as stress and despair intertwined into a web of epilepsy diagnosis and relentless hospital visits after breakdowns. In the midst of this chaos, my departed grandfather stood as my sole anchor, his absence fueling my fear of loss and desertion that now looms over every relationship like an unshakable shadow.\n\nDreams shattered before realization crushed me further; rejected opportunities and dashed hopes fuelled by patriarchal norms pushed me deeper into despair. Seeking refuge in medications only served to exacerbate my struggles as addiction crept insidiously into every facet of my existence, leaving behind ravaged health and shattered aspirations. Each passing moment heralded new depths of self-loathing as thoughts of failure consumed whatever little light remained within me.\n\nThe road ahead seems bleak and insurmountable as the weight of past traumas compounds with present struggles, leaving behind a broken soul yearning for respite from this unending turmoil.

{"prompt":"The idea of death seems like a merciful escape that I don't believe I deserve. Suicidal thoughts have plagued me for years, though it was only recently that I was diagnosed with psychological struggles. Unfortunately, the financial burden of seeking professional help in my country made me reluctant to approach my parents for assistance. As a result, I've become a chronic absentee when it comes to appointments with my psychologist and school counselors due to the overwhelming costs involved. The urge to end my own life has become alarmingly familiar over time, almost becoming a twisted preoccupation. During my idle moments, I've contemplated and meticulously planned various methods of self-harm within the confines of my home quarantine. From calculating the lethal amount of isopropyl alcohol for poisoning to testing potential anchor points for a noose, from timing the movements of a loud neighbor's sports car to considering stepping in front of it (a notion swiftly dismissed out of consideration for their well-being), I've wandered down dark paths in search of an escape route from my inner turmoil.\n\nDespite diversions like these dark musings, deep down, I find myself consumed with self-loathing as the root cause of wanting to end this existence. It seems simple—I despise myself and struggle to offer any kindness or compassion inwardly while readily extending it outwardly towards others whom I find fascinating in their humanity. However, self-love remains elusive despite earnest desires not to be hypocritical in this regard.\n\nIn times of vulnerability—seemingly an unending state lately—I subject myself to a barrage of cruel words: foolish, failure, cowardly, burdensome... each one stabbing at the fragile remnants of self-worth I cling onto. Despite well-meaning efforts from loved ones and professionals seeking to dispel these harmful thoughts as baseless, they only seem to deepen my feelings of worthlessness and guilt over causing concern where none should exist.\n\nIn the wake of personal tragedies and failed attempts at solace through hobbies or therapies that once held promise, hope seems lost within this internal storm. Overwhelmed by grief since losing my mother earlier this year—a loss that has left me numb save for relentless anxiety and self-reproach—I struggle to see a future worth enduring.\n\nThe allure of death looms large, presenting itself as an easy exit from this painful reality; yet deep down lurks an innate belief that such respite is undeserved—a leniency unfit for someone who perceives themselves as having inflicted pain upon others. The idea is thus dismissed; punishment through prolonged suffering feels more apt for someone who deems themselves beyond redemption.\n\nSeeking solace in sharing these raw emotions here might offer temporary reprieve or simply serve as a feeble attempt at connection amidst this darkness that isolates me within myself. While advice or understanding may be offered by compassionate strangers here, doubts linger about the efficacy when even articulating my own anguish proves daunting.\n\nThis post serves no grand purpose but perhaps seeks solidarity amidst those who battle similar demons silently daily—adding a voice veiled by anonymity yet seeking communion in shared struggles through these words on a screen.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

My mom is also out of work, and out of pride, I can't bring myself to tell my dad about losing mine. On top of this, I am a student who might have to drop out due to these circumstances. In a brief five-minute Zoom call, everything that brought me comfort was snatched away. The specialized nature of my role at work makes it unlikely that I'll find something comparable elsewhere; it's not a widely transferable skill either. Finally being able to sustain myself financially was the one thing that made me feel somewhat content with who I am, but now even that has been taken away. It feels like my ex's hurtful words about being worthless and better off dead are proving true. The future looks bleak without any prospects for years, if ever.\n\nLife has always been a struggle for me, and every time something positive comes along, it is cruelly yanked away. At 27 years old without a degree, partner, or job - there seems little reason to continue enduring this cycle of loss and disappointment. Since childhood, I've seen living as an insincere facade yet feared taking control over my own life due to other people's expectations and my own anxieties - now those fears seem insignificant.\n\nMy suffering seems endless because of the choices made by my parents which have ultimately led me here. As such, thoughts of driving out into the mountains alone cross my mind where I could possibly find solace in peace as a final resort.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

I can already predict the typical response: \"if everything is ultimately meaningless, then the insignificance of it all shouldn't affect you.\" However, this perspective offers me no solace. It doesn't inspire me to rebel and embrace life with gusto since I've reached a point of detachment where I'll simply let things be until my last breath. Frankly, I'm weary of society's obsession with constructing a persona and embodying virtues like kindness. It seems like everyone desires you to fit their mold. I have no interest in adopting a cheerful outlook or exuding self-assurance; these qualities elude me, and even if I possessed them, they wouldn't appeal to me. That's my stance. Given the freedom as humans to choose any demeanor, my choice would be to have none at all. I aspire to be the vanished pixel on a screen or the forgotten puzzle piece that never gets discovered. The superficiality around me is suffocating - everyone fixated on appearances. Perhaps it's time for me to mirror my disdain for humanity by being impolite to others. The knowledge of a heaven distresses me deeply; vanishing into eternal obscurity is what I crave, yet divine intervention would hinder such oblivion. The realization that my life will end at 35 looms over me - at 22 now, that seems to be my ultimate horizon. The most challenging aspect is contemplating the anguish my absence will inflict on those dear to me and who hold me in their hearts; although in the grand scheme of things, I doubt it will significantly alter anything.

He shares how he disliked college but was fortunate enough to make connections and build a social circle that helped him cope. He mentions that he might have dropped out if not for meeting those people. How am I supposed to react to that? Congratulations on being lucky enough to experience that while I'm here, just going through the motions every day without interacting with anyone. Unlike me, he doesn't even have to make an effort to socialize; girls approach him first. It's disheartening being around him. College seems like a lost cause for me now; I've messed up significantly for the second time. I can't handle this constant sense of dread and anxiety anymore. Waking up in the morning only serves as a painful reminder of having to attend school or college. It's unbearable. My family is not terrible, and my childhood was ordinary yet lonely, but I feel no connection to them anymore. Despite my mum cooking meals for me and doing my laundry, I feel numb towards them; it's just frustration lingering within me. Motivation eludes me entirely; even after writing two stories, I can't bring myself to write more - it's vanished. Consistently reading books is a struggle too; sometimes I read for a month and then stop for three months. How can I secure a job when I can't even maintain interest in activities that I enjoy? Even sticking to regular hygiene habits like showering is challenging; it's become routine for me to forego showers for up to a week or even two at times.

The truth is, much of the misery in my life stems from factors completely beyond my control. It's disheartening to see how for some, life seems like a dreadful curse while for others, it's smooth sailing. The current scenario where individuals are toiling extensively yet reaping dwindling rewards just to feed the insatiable greed of a few billionaires adds another layer of despair.\n\nAs a man, navigating the realm of love has proven to be quite challenging for me. Striving for equitable treatment and fair expectations should be straightforward, yet I find myself criticized for simply desiring a reciprocal and respectful relationship (and let me clarify – appearances aren't what matter here; sincerity does). It feels unjust that women seem to have the privilege of choosing while men are expected to shoulder the burden of pursuit (talk about equality, right?). Enduring a lifetime of bullying, harassment, and general mistreatment has taken its toll on me. Moreover, being unable to align with the stringent faith I was brought up in leaves me feeling alienated from my own family with no solace or support from a loving partner.\n\nSurviving within the constraints of South Asian Muslim culture, even in a Western setting, presents its own set of challenges that often go unnoticed. It's disheartening that whenever I voice my struggles and seek empathy, I'm met with criticism and blame instead – it's as if there's joy in kicking someone when they're already down. While hard work undoubtedly plays a role in shaping our paths and making incremental changes possible, there's no denying that luck remains an influential determinant at the core of our experiences.

We're slaves to our routines, and I can't help but feel that any fiction turned reality only serves to manipulate and control us, including something as pervasive as music and even money itself.

Despite my relentless efforts, mastery remains elusive; even interviews present a formidable challenge. Enduring this relentless cycle feels increasingly insurmountable. The perpetual inadequacy gnaws at my self-worth, compounded by financial stressors in the face of exorbitant costs and convoluted housing in the UK.

Your relationship with your parents might not have been ideal, either too distant or overly suffocating with their love. Perhaps at times you've considered turning to drugs or alcohol to cope with stress. However, deep down, the fear of such actions holds you back; even suicidal thoughts act as a coping mechanism, just another way to escape reality and remain inactive. The truth is, the thought of taking such drastic measures is terrifying; even summoning the courage and determination for suicide proves harder than carrying it out. It's common for people to harbor self-loathing, and even those who claim otherwise often struggle with self-acceptance as a way of avoiding deeper introspection. If the idea of ending it all resurfaces and you are determined to follow through, don't go quietly into the darkness. Make a statement in a grand way if that's your choice - make the world see that you viewed yourself as normal and it's society that has failed you; the fault lies with the world, not with you. With some basic tools and resources like extension ladders and wire cutters obtained discreetly, unfathomable chaos could ensue - though this is no joke.

The initial job I secured deceptively altered its requirements, confining me to a dreadful position. Subsequently, leveraging my limited connections from university, I secured another job; however, doubts linger about future opportunities. Various missteps have already occurred - missing important emails and delaying paperwork with HR - further exacerbated by recent events. Assigned to a QA team today instead of software development, I reluctantly agreed out of apprehension linked to prior experiences.

While I swiftly apologized and found common ground with my new team members, an overwhelming sense of foreboding persists. The fear of not securing another job looms large; failure would render me incapable of meeting rent obligations.

{"prompt":"Why do people still desire to bring children into this bleak modern society? Do they fail to grasp the deteriorating state of the world, hurtling towards chaos? It seems glaringly obvious. Why is it that individuals grappling with mental health challenges seem to have a clearer understanding of these impending crises compared to those considered 'normal'? I've been labeled as pessimistic simply because I'm enduring immense suffering; however, it is through my struggles with mental illness and suicidal ideation that I've gained a deeper insight into the world and potential solutions. Sadly, my candid realism has attracted disdain and criticism. There appears to be no room for nuanced perspectives – only harsh judgment from rigid religious beliefs and societal constructs. If someone battling mental health issues or contemplating suicide still harbors the desire to become a parent, I hold no condemnation – they could very well excel in that role.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}
{"prompt":"I'm a 21-year-old male and it feels like love is something I'll never experience. My mental and emotional instability, along with what I perceive as my peculiarities and flaws, make me believe that being loved is out of reach for me. All I truly crave is to find a woman to share my life with, but the harsh truth is that I see myself as a failure who will likely end up alone. Admitting to my parents that I need assistance seems daunting. My battle with moderate depression and anxiety led me to quit drinking, but strangely, my mental state has deteriorated even further. Getting out of bed feels impossible, and the thoughts of ending it all plague me constantly. With no friends by my side now, seeking therapy and medication appears to be my only lifeline. The challenge lies in confessing to my parents about needing therapy due to financial constraints, especially since communication isn't something I excel at with them. It's a relentless cycle of self-sabotage. At 21, the repeated failures in trying to make things right only reinforce the belief that loneliness and death are inevitable outcomes for me. Despite feeling prepared for death due to an irreparable fallout with all my friends, I lack the courage to take matters into my own hands – hoping that fate itself will intervene one way or another. \n\nWith Valentine's Day looming, the stark reality of being alone hits harder – a painful reminder of my perpetual solitude and the absence of any significant romantic relationships in my life so far. Today's altercation with friends further solidifies the notion of toxicity within me, driving me towards seeking solace in alcohol while contemplating darker alternatives. For those whom I've let down along the way, perhaps exiting this world would be a relief for everyone else. \n\nMy distorted perception towards women and how I tend to objectify them has only added another layer to my estrangement from potential relationships. This internal struggle not only affects real-life interactions but also taints how I view women portrayed on screen – leading to discomfort around them and an ongoing challenge in controlling these thoughts. Once again faced with another Valentine's Day spent in solitude, drowning myself in alcohol becomes a means to escape – hoping that tomorrow won't arrive.\n\nValentine's Day stands as a poignant symbol of inadequacy for me at 21 - a stark contrast against what seems like everyone around me finding companionship while I linger in isolation throughout my existence yearning for it all to cease at once'.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

{"prompt":"I feel like I can't go on anymore. Hi. You don't know me, but I thought I could share here. My family recently had a massive argument about our issues and everything going on. I've been battling suicidal thoughts for around 6 years now; there was an attempt when I was 14, and I barely survived. Since then, there have been a few close calls, but none successful. Upon returning to my home country, I find myself trapped in the same struggles. My girlfriend has been my only support through all the pain, yet my family disapproves of her. They used to run a program for people unable to afford their visa fees, including her, but stopped when they found out about us. Now we talk about wanting to be together, but the circumstances seem impossible. The inability to save up to visit her due to being unable to return to Australia adds to the despair. I haven't disclosed to my family that we still communicate. It's disheartening; it feels like there's no purpose left for me. Trying to pursue happiness has only led me to become a lonely youth in a dim room wishing for something good to come my way. Watching others progress with their lives after dropping out of school is tough; they have their partners by their side while expressing how much they miss them - a scenario that seems worlds apart from mine. Despite everything, I cling onto hope that one day we can truly be together after enduring this long-distance relationship for a year with just three months spent together before she had to leave. Dealing with a Christian family that believes being with her goes against God's will is another layer of complexity. Personally, I trust that God, who embodies love itself, would sanction our union, but that decision isn't mine to make. There's this overwhelming feeling of not wanting to continue anymore; it's been a journey so far, but perhaps this world isn't meant for me after all. The fact that even if I desire it, I can't go is crushing; envisioning her in tears devastates me on another level—I'm immobilized and utterly alone in this struggle.\n\nTo sum it up - If you have your beloved by your side—the person you'd move heaven and earth for—cherish them dearly because life is fleeting and not everyone gets that fairy-tale ending as far as my experiences have taught me.\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}

My life feels stagnant, and all I yearn for when I return home is rest. The meager pay I receive is further diminished when my mother takes a significant portion. The idea of taking my own life has crossed my thoughts, considering that it may not differ much from the suffering I currently endure. While I hate feeling like a victim, it seems like the circumstances of my life have been leading me towards failure or making success incredibly challenging to attain. I also believe that my family plays a role in this; being raised by a single mother surrounded by female relatives has hindered me in many ways. Now, I am stuck in a job that brings me no fulfillment and relies on transportation that is causing harm to my body. The physical strain from work further exacerbates this issue, leaving me with little time for recovery before enduring the commute back home. The financial compensation does not justify the toll it takes on me, especially when a large portion goes towards bills. Saving up is challenging as I must constantly invest in healthy food due to my family's poor diet choices. By the time the next paycheck arrives, my bank account is nearly empty.

The feeling of being an outsider has lingered since the days of my father's abuse; there's this relentless fear that it will forever define me.\n\nYearning for love in my life—longing for warm embraces and reassuring words telling me that I matter and will be okay—I find myself barely holding on by a thread currently. Searching for flickers of joy in the world akin to those experiencing during childhood. However, every time I confront my inner demons head-on, they wage a fierce battle to consume me entirely. The thought that nothing would change if I disappeared weighs heavily; it seems like mere recollections fading away from everyone who has crossed paths with me.\n\nDespite these hardships, what keeps me anchored now is attempting to uncover value in the present moment—even amidst unending pain and sorrow.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" in"}
{"prompt":"I'm contemplating the idea that ending my life may be the most pragmatic choice. Upon reflection, I struggle to identify any flaws in this line of thinking. Admittingly, I grapple with anger issues that have significantly strained my relationships with others, causing pain to past partners, friends, and family members. It's worth noting that much of this anger is directed inward. Although I have never harmed another person or their belongings, except for instances when I've been alone. Despite the presence of individuals who still care for me, their numbers seem to diminish each passing day. When looking at it from a utilitarian standpoint, it appears that the emotional suffering my continued existence would bring – both to myself and others down the line – outweighs any benefits of remaining on this earth. Typically, I find solace in believing that the act of taking my own life would result in more pain than enduring through future hardships. Unfortunately, lately, I've been unable to convince myself of this notion and seek reassurance regarding whether my decision is justified. Additionally, there's a part of me that instinctively feels suicide isn't the right course of action and perhaps this plea serves as a cry for help; however, despite my internal conflict, I struggle to find a compelling reason to heed that inner voice given the logical appraisal I've outlined above.

{"prompt":"I am overwhelmed with anxiety about what lies ahead. The thought of focusing on studying for exams is daunting as I'm struggling to hold back tears. My mental well-being throughout this school year has deteriorated significantly. Apart from my parents, I've only sporadically confided in one other person. The stack of incomplete assignments keeps growing, and it's almost a miracle that I manage a C- in my most challenging subjects. The realization that I missed the window to submit past assignments due to a policy outlined in the syllabus, which I failed to read, is disheartening. The pressure mounts with an upcoming AP Biology exam on Thursday. Neglecting my studies all semester has led me to rely solely on quizlet for that grade. It's all becoming too much. While I acknowledge that there are only two weeks left before it's all over, the weight of it all is suffocating. Following my recent AP exam last Thursday, memories are overshadowed by endless study sessions and tearful nights. It's alarming how thoughts of suicide now creep into my mind when they never did in the past year and then some. If not for my parents, I might not care at all. They seem to expect exceptional achievements from me, although they have never explicitly articulated it. They recognize my intelligence, as do I, but remain unaware of the turmoil within my mind. As discussions about the future become more frequent as I grow older, questions about college choices, majors, and career paths arise from my parents; however, I'm lost in uncertainty. This internal confusion has been unvoiced for far too long—I simply don't have the answers everyone expects me to have. Plagued by the absence of friends who have drifted away, I find solace in activities that once brought joy but now offer no comfort amidst this abyss of despair. Struggling with this breakdown of long-standing coping mechanisms feels isolating and hopeless. At 15 years old, venting these pent-up frustrations feels pathetic and self-indulgent; comparing them to real issues faced by others deepens this sense of insignificance. In moments like these, contemplating mortality brings a sense of apathy—after all, we all meet the same end eventually—so why should any of this matter? Has anyone else reached a point where tears simply won't come anymore?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

I have always been overlooked by women, never seen as a potential partner. I constantly fall short, perpetually deemed inadequate. This intangible quality that others possess, I lack it entirely. The current state of society, with its social conventions and the prevalence of dating apps like Tinder, has made it nearly impossible for men who do not meet conventional standards to lead fulfilling lives. Resentment towards women festers within me for the way they have repeatedly turned me down or confined me to the role of a friend. I am overwhelmed by these feelings of rejection. In this moment of despair, all I can do is drown my sorrows in alcohol. Living like this is unbearable. Encounters with women only result in dismissal or the dreaded label of \"just friends.\" Women seem to hold all the power effortlessly, while I languish in misery. The overwhelming urge to end my own life haunts me relentlessly because I cannot envision a future where things improve. The lost time, opportunities, and experiences can never be reclaimed. The agony of feeling like a worthless individual weighs heavily on my soul.

Moreover, she has manipulated images to fabricate false conversations between my friend and others in an attempt to tarnish her reputation.

Despite acknowledging that there are some redeeming qualities within me - a handful of talents and positive attributes - I am overwhelmingly filled with disdain for myself. The thought of my existence is abhorrent, and every aspect of my life feels revolting and pitiful. I perceive myself as a woeful and unintelligent individual, wishing fervently that I had never been born. The mere notion of someone glimpsing into the reality of my life fills me with an intense desire to end it all. I am plagued by a strong urge to take my own life, pondering on why there aren't people out there targeting individuals like me instead of innocent victims. It is evident to me that some lives hold no value, including mine among the 7 billion inhabitants on this planet. If only I could gather the courage to meet a tragic end by throwing myself in front of a train, ensuring that my identity would be forever concealed in the aftermath. The magnitude of my self-loathing is profound, compounded by the shame I would feel if anyone were to discover these thoughts that I am now expressing. My inner turmoil is so severe, it makes me wish to escape from my own skin. What torments me even more is the likelihood that those around me would dissect my existence in search of reasons for my demise if I were to follow through with such dark impulses. The initial shock and disbelief would inevitably evolve into sympathetic murmurs about the unfortunate circumstances surrounding my decision. Despite few who may genuinely care for me at a deeper level, most relationships exist on surface pleasantries alone, ready to move on swiftly after expressing momentary condolences over my passing since our connections are not deeply intertwined.

I recall experiencing being scolded, slapped, losing my ability to hear and stand, and the subsequent hospital visit. When I turned 21, I acquired a gun, my first experience handling one. Despite thorough research on aiming at a fatal spot on my head to prevent survival chances, the fear of pain overwhelmed me.

It's as though I'm just a hollow shell of a person, and I can't comprehend what has led me to this desolate state. The individuals I used to converse with have drifted away, severing any possibility of forming meaningful relationships. I find myself deteriorating slowly, pretending everything is fine while battling my inner turmoil. The breakdown of my car seems like a cruel twist of fate that would only accelerate my descent into oblivion. To preserve the savings I plan on leaving behind, I've resorted to starving myself, further illustrating how little value I place on my own well-being.\n\nObserving an elderly couple arguing over a trivial amount at the cashier fills me with bitterness; if only such mundane concerns were the extent of my worries in life. It pains me to think that after being nurtured for 18 years, all I amount to is a drain on resources without the capacity to support or shield anyone, least of all myself – a stark reality that underscores my existence.\n\nThe countdown continues as I endure the meaninglessness of my existence marked by futile posts and an overwhelming sense of detachment from life. The prospect of death looms as the solitary beacon of hope in an otherwise bleak existence. Despite my plea for assistance appearing twice, it seems futile as no one seems able to comprehend the depth of despair that clouds my thoughts.\n\nIn another attempt to reach out, I am contemplating collaborating on a book centered around suicide – aptly titled \"suicide club.\" Striving for multiple contributors who share a penchant for dark themes and writing, each responsible for crafting three chapters comprising 2,000 words each; fostering a twisted narrative reflective of our morbid imaginations.

{"prompt":"I'm reflecting on an incident that occurred seven months ago when I was 17 years old. During a visit to a friend's lake house in April, I had a fall from a tire swing that was just about 2 feet off the ground, landing directly on my back. Initially, I didn't notice any significant changes, but later that evening, I started feeling unwell and fatigued without experiencing any major symptoms. Upon returning home two days later, I began feeling slightly off, with a persistent foggy and fuzzy sensation in my head.\n\nAfter about a week of these symptoms persisting, I consulted my regular physician who promptly diagnosed me with a concussion. As my symptoms remained consistent, I sought the opinion of a neurologist who identified it as post-concussion syndrome. Oddly enough, I didn't exhibit the typical signs associated with concussions; my primary complaint was the persistent fogginess.\n\nIn an attempt to find relief, I visited a chiropractor which unfortunately did not alleviate my symptoms. As summer drew to a close, despite trying to relax through golfing activities, things took a turn for the worse. The sensation in my head transformed from mere fogginess to feeling as though there was hot water sloshing around inside it – an incredibly discomforting experience.\n\nSubsequently, I turned to a naturopathic doctor practicing natural medicine who expressed confidence in addressing all my symptoms. Various diagnostic tests including MRI scans and x-rays were conducted on my back and neck regions followed by consultations at concussion clinics – all yielding no improvement.\n\nAt the suggestion of my mother, I tried CBD oil which instead of helping exacerbated the inflammation in my head significantly. This led me back to the naturopathic doctor who then recommended consulting vision specialists and undergoing neurotransmitter testing. The hypothesis shifted towards anxiety as being at the root of my issues leading to the initiation of Cymbalta treatment.\n\nDespite gradually increasing doses up to 30 - 60 - 30 MG of Cymbalta, none of these interventions provided any relief. A deficiency in vitamin D was revealed by the neurotransmitter test for which supplements were prescribed but offered no respite either. Additionally, elevated cortisol levels were noted by the doctor alongside comparisons suggesting it resembled levels observed after confronting stressful situations.\n\nSymptoms such as facial tightness, stiff neck muscles, taut temples, sensations akin to warm water or zapping movements around my head and temples intensified when leaning against surfaces causing discomfort further exacerbated by itching around my eyes. Prolonged sitting worsened these sensations while an internal itching sensation within my head persisted along with unusual movements felt centrally along my spine against any support.\n\nThe most distressing symptom remains this persistent sensation of intense heat and inflammation within my head often accompanied by perceptible movement felt within it.

The depth of my love for him and the gratitude I felt for our togetherness now seem overshadowed by doubt and despair. I feel paralyzed, unsure of how to move forward, resigned to let fate take its course apathetically.

{"prompt":"I am in desperate need of assistance. Approximately a month ago, my partner of a decade abruptly departed on my birthday, leaving me bewildered. Without any explanation, they simply packed their belongings and announced their departure. I am left without closure, clueless as to what transpired. Despite enduring physical and emotional abuse from her, I never dared to disclose it to anyone due to the emasculating shame associated with detailing how my female partner would turn violent during heated arguments at home. She persistently urged me to seek therapy for years, a journey I embarked on during the pandemic to better myself mentally. However, she seemed to resent the improved version of myself that emerged from that process. Now in my thirties, I feel like a worthless existence with no purpose. She took along all our mutual friends, leaving me entirely isolated. Seeking solace with family by journeying across the country only served as a stark reminder of why I distanced myself from them initially, exacerbating my mental anguish. Strangely enough, I found more happiness being alone with my canine companion in my car with nowhere specific to go.\n\nI have ceased taking my prescribed medication and turned to heavy drinking - a habit I had managed to abstain from for nearly a year. Today marked the consumption of my final Ativan dosage, which had been instrumental in preventing me from spiraling out of control. Fearing that my psychiatrist may refuse further prescriptions, everything appears bleak and insurmountable. It feels as though for certain individuals, suicide is their destined path in life and perhaps I am gradually coming to terms with that possibility. Regrettably, expressing these sentiments openly with either my therapist or psychiatrist seems unfeasible out of dread of being involuntarily committed. Aware of my inclination to deceive in order to evade such situations; such impedance would only foster thoughts of self-harm further.\n\nI fail to comprehend why those whom I believed loved me would inflict such profound pain upon me. It almost seems as though somehow I have accrued negative karma and consequently deserve this suffering; nature's way of signaling that it is time for me to bid adieu.

This plight is infuriating. Society's current state entwined with the prevalence of platforms like Tinder has created a scenario where men deemed below average struggle to find contentment in life. Resentment towards women grows within me for the constant rejection or relegation to the friend zone that I face repeatedly. The weight of these experiences is crushing; carrying on feels futile. My disdain for this world intensifies with each passing moment, driving me to drown my sorrows in alcohol as I am doing right now. This manner of existence is no longer tolerable for me. Encounters with women only bring rejection or platonic relations - dismissing phrases such as \"you're such a great guy,\" \"you'll find someone,\" or \"let's remain friends\" only adds fuel to the fire of my despair. Women seem to enjoy unwarranted privileges in this societal structure. The overpowering desire for self-annihilation looms over my thoughts incessantly. A better future appears unattainable - lost time, experiences, and opportunities will never be reclaimed. The prolonged feeling of worthlessness has become insufferable; disdain for the world festers within me.

Objectively speaking, things should be going well for me – I have a supportive family, a steady job, and financial stability. Yet, the very reasons that drive me towards thoughts of wanting to end it all stem from my own perceived failings. My body image issues weigh heavily on me; grappling with being overweight has always been a struggle, despite my efforts to shed the pounds. Even as I make progress in my weight loss journey, I continue to despise my physical appearance, fixating on every imperfection that stands out, convinced they will never fade away. Compounded by being a transgender man who remains misgendered despite undergoing hormone therapy for two years, the intersection of body dysphoria and weight struggles amplifies my self-hatred. What complicates matters further is my romantic and sexual orientation – being attracted to men while also navigating a possible asexual identity leaves me feeling undesirable and unworthy of love. The ghost of past heartbreak looms large; feeling inadequate in my previous relationship with another transgender man who failed to see me as sufficiently masculine reinforces my belief that I will never measure up. Not fitting into societal norms regarding gender and sexuality creates a sense of alienation and rejection that permeates every aspect of my life. While I don't harbor genuine intentions of ending my life, the pervasive belief that others would be better off without the burden of dealing with me lingers heavily.

Despite thorough research on aiming at a fatal spot on my head to avoid surviving a gunshot wound, fear gripped me as I realized the pain involved; even after loading a round into the chamber, a slight misalignment of the slide prevented the trigger from firing properly. The sheer dread of pain was paralyzing, dissuading me from attempting another shot after rectifying my mistake. Concerns for my safety intensified as people recognized my self-endangering behavior, eventually leading to hospitalization.\n\nMore recently, I acquired rope sturdy enough to bear my weight without anticipating it would be necessary. After studying partial suspension hanging techniques and meticulously positioning the noose, I executed the plan in a secluded area but only experienced excruciating pressure in my head instead of losing consciousness as expected. Faced with overwhelming discomfort and discoloration from burst blood vessels in my face, I abandoned the attempt realizing a full hanging was beyond what I could endure.\n\nToday, my exit bag is ready. The setup was flawless yet triggering unexpected panic when turning on the gas due to its piercing sound near my ear and an unforeseen chest discomfort even though it shouldn't cause physical pain according to plan. This moment left me stunned with mixed emotions. While aware of the method's efficacy when executed correctly (which is the case here), grappling with writing a final anguished note with no one left in my life stings profoundly.\n\nComing to terms with this stark reality aligning with my fears feels surreal. Battling suicidal thoughts for an extended period led to emotional numbness until now where loneliness and anxiety intertwine within me concerning this irreversible decision. Uncertain about what support or solace I seek through these words, the fear of both failing at this attempt and confronting death coexist within me.\n\nRegret weighs heavy as recent decisions alienated those dear few individuals still present in my life whether inadvertently or by design. Overwhelmed by solitude and weariness, I stand at this crossroads feeling utterly depleted.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}

I've disappointed as a son, a brother, a romantic partner, a parent, an employee, a friend, a grandson, and a nephew. Lately, I've attempted to end my life twice in the past 4 days. I can't bear to meet my girlfriend's gaze, let alone muster the courage to seek help. It dawned on me that I haven't looked at myself in the mirror for years because I can't stand the reflection staring back at me. Sure, I've glanced at my attire or admired a new haircut but delving deeper is an overwhelming task. The image I project is that of a resilient man and admitting that this front is crumbling terrifies me to the point where I've shut myself off from everyone, including myself.\n\nI have neglected my job for 4 days now; not even managing to leave bed. My girlfriend likely believes I despise her because articulating my desire to end it all feels impossible. As for my son whom I lost custody of last year, he must be wondering why his father has emotionally checked out. Yet, deep down, I doubt if I have anything positive left to offer him in terms of guidance. My colleagues are probably puzzled by my sudden disappearance without any explanation; in all likelihood having given up on me just as much as I have abandoned hope in myself long ago.\n\nI drown my sorrows in alcohol, cigarettes, and numbing substances because only then does the self-loathing momentarily subside. But when clarity hits fleetingly amidst the haze, the self-hatred intensifies further. Just yesterday, I ingested two dozen muscle relaxers and four dozen painkillers hoping not to wake up this morning; however here I am once again - drowning in inadequacy and self-disgust. The most frightening part is that despite being terrified while taking those pills, there was a strange solace in knowing that if gone, there wouldn't be another chance for me to disappoint anyone ever again.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}

My father's constant frustration over trivial matters and the apparent indifference from my friends have only exacerbated my feelings of isolation.

Trapped within my own mind and plagued by illness, I have always yearned to find a place where I truly belong.

Everyone deserves reassurance that things will improve, especially those who are still in school – there are boundless opportunities ahead that can unexpectedly transform your life in remarkable ways. Over time, as experiences shape you, your perspective on what holds true value will undoubtedly evolve for the better.\n\nDrawing from personal insight, I feel compelled to stress that unless one has endured a profound loss (I purposefully keep this ambiguous considering the myriad forms it may take), there remains a significant likelihood of emerging from the current struggles. It may not seem possible now, but with patience and resilience, you will reach a point where looking back fills you with pride for having persevered. Hold onto hope and demonstrate to yourself and to life itself your strength in weathering this storm. Then, when ready, reflect on your journey.\n\nFurthermore, if your parents – or even just one of them – are still present and their love anchors you, please spare them the unbearable agony of witnessing the loss of both their own parents and their child. The thought of inflicting such pain upon them is perhaps one of the greatest sources of anguish one can fathom.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" in"}

All I yearn for is a peaceful slumber without the turmoil of waking up to another day of stress.\n\nSometimes, I fantasize about going on a long car ride while listening to music, wishing it could last forever. My academic performance is declining, and my social circle is shrinking due to my tendency to overshare as a result of severe social anxiety.

{"prompt":"I feel like death would be a merciful escape for me, though I don't believe I deserve it. The struggle with suicidal thoughts has been a long-standing issue, but it's only recently that I received a psychological diagnosis. Despite this, I have hesitated to seek help due to the financial burden it would place on my parents in my country. Admittedly, I tend to avoid appointments with my psychologist and school counselors to evade the associated costs. The thought of ending my life has become almost habitual over the years, occupying much of my spare time. I've contemplated various methods of suicide within the confines of my home quarantine situation.\n\nFrom calculating the amount of isopropyl alcohol needed for a fatal overdose to testing the strength of potential hanging points, I have explored numerous options. Even planning a potential collision with a neighbor's loud car has crossed my mind, though discarded due to concerns about traumatizing them. Ensuring that my family wouldn't discover me in the act has also been part of these dark musings.\n\nLately, these morbid thoughts seem like an ongoing pastime. My self-loathing has grown so profound that it drives this desire for death – plain and simple. While I find beauty and wonder in others effortlessly, extending the same grace to myself proves impossible. Negative self-talk – labeling myself as an idiot, coward, or failure – dominates in moments of vulnerability that now feel like a constant state.\n\nDespite reaching out to friends and family and even seeking professional assistance (the cost of which proves prohibitive for continuous treatment), relief seems elusive. Medications are losing their efficacy, and stronger alternatives are financially out of reach. Pursuing hobbies or rekindling past passions no longer provide solace after experiencing significant losses this year, particularly the passing of my mother.\n\nGrief and anxiety weigh heavily on me in her absence; guilt further compounds these emotions without allowing me space to mourn openly due to privacy concerns online. Though support strategies that once helped are now ineffective, carrying on feels like an obligation rather than a choice for someone who believes they've caused harm to others.\n\nThe allure of suicide persists with detailed plans and available means at hand but remains unacted upon out of a sense of unworthiness. Death seems too simple a resolution for someone burdened by guilt and hurtful actions towards others; facing continued suffering feels more justifiable given this internal turmoil.\n\nUncertain if this rationale provides enough reason to persist through these thoughts without acting upon them, sharing these feelings here serves as more of a contribution than an expectation for guidance or advice which often falls short in adequately addressing my struggles due to their complexity and personal nature.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}
{"prompt":"Contemplating seeking help at the hospital due to suicidal thoughts but facing a setback as my insurance won't be active until February 1st. Dealing with a severe depressive episode compounded by my diagnosis of bipolar 1 that I've been managing for over 7 years. The current situation with the pandemic and juggling two jobs has eliminated my usual coping mechanisms. These involved engaging in painting, setting achievable daily goals, and seeking human interaction by being in public spaces - none of which are viable options presently. Consequently, I feel like I'm descending deeper into despair. While I'm not an immediate danger to myself, the situation could escalate. Attempts to confide in friends and family have been met with limited assistance; my sister dismissed my concerns as complaining and urged me to focus on practical solutions within my control, while my parents advised me to concentrate on positive aspects.\n\nThe main obstacle preventing me from seeking medical attention is the lack of insurance until the start of next month, coupled with starting a new part-time teaching job two weeks ago. Abruptly leaving without explanation would create difficulties for the staff, and even if allowed to continue, navigating reintegration into the class would pose significant challenges. Therefore, I'm at a loss regarding what steps to take. Waiting until the 1st of February seems like an eternity in the midst of this depression. Balancing financial concerns, maintaining stability at home, and grappling with doubts about my suitability for teaching young students while experiencing mood swings and occasional psychotic symptoms like visual hallucinations and delusions are all factors weighing heavily on me.\n\nSeeking suggestions or guidance if anyone has faced a similar predicament would be greatly appreciated.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

The mere thought of stepping outside my comfort zone overwhelms me, be it running errands or forming connections with others. \n\nIn my mind, I've constructed elaborate relationships and scenarios that seem more fulfilling than my current reality. While I aspire to grow and make progress each day, the journey feels sluggish, marred by a sense of underachievement and unfulfilled potential.

It seems as though every part of me is flawed, and this feeling might persist for the rest of my days, which is particularly distressing because I believe I shouldn't be feeling this way. On the surface, it may seem like everything in my life is in order - I have a supportive family, a job, and can manage my finances. Yet, deep down, I blame myself for the desire to end it all. My negative body image plays a significant role in this turmoil; being overweight has always plagued me, and despite efforts to shed the pounds, I still despise my appearance. My insecurities are further compounded by gender dysphoria as a transgender man. Despite being on testosterone for two years, others still perceive me as female due to my reluctance to correct them. This conflict between weight issues and dysphoria intensifies my self-hatred.\n\nTo make matters more complicated, I also grapple with conflicting sexual orientations - being attracted to men while possibly identifying as asexual. The fear of being undesirable looms large; in my past relationship with another transgender man, it ended perhaps due to my perceived lack of masculinity. This rejection not only highlights my struggle with fitting societal norms but also adds another barrier with regard to sexual intimacy. While I don't have intentions of taking drastic actions, I can't shake the belief that everyone around me would be better off without having to deal with me - whether it's listening to my grievances or navigating the complexities of having a transgender loved one.\n\nThe overwhelming sense of embarrassment and worthlessness weighs heavily on me; it feels like I don't deserve the love and support from friends or family.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" in"}

Amid coping with the aftermath of a failed suicide attempt, physical suffering, unrelenting depression, and an enduring desire to cease existing, it is the weight of school that has felt most crushing.

The weight of my experiences weighs heavily on me; they're so harrowing and convoluted that sharing them would be an unbearable burden for anyone.

I have no desire to replace them or seek out new connections; my spirit is weary and fragile beyond repair. After this person, there can be no other in my heart. Despite making some progress, external factors such as my living arrangements and compounded traumatic events continue to plague me relentlessly. Witnessing those who inflicted harm upon me reveling in their happy endings while justice remains elusive has only intensified my anguish. The mere thought of throwing myself in front of an oncoming Amtrak or Metrolink train has crossed my mind more than once as an escape from this anguish. My intention is not to cause pain to the few individuals who care for me or even the one I hold dear, but deep down, I fear that nobody would truly mourn my passing; in fact, it might even bring joy to some. My primary struggle lies in overcoming this paralyzing fear that causes me to retreat at the sight of approaching danger every single time – even though I know the train schedules by heart as I reside near the tracks. In those critical moments when panic sets in and tears begin to fall, how can I find the courage to stand firm and not veer off course?

{"prompt":"My struggles seem to be escalating, and the thought of ending my own life lingers persistently, despite my inability to actually carry it out. Each passing day brings a heavier burden of unresolved issues. The lingering impact of emotional neglect from my parents has left me yearning for the love and attention I never received, essentially becoming the driving force behind my will to live. This perpetual cycle typically initiates with witnessing others receive praise, leading me to believe that I must achieve similar accomplishments or possessions in order to be worthy of love. Even seemingly mundane things like observing a drawing can spiral me into deeper states of despair. Seeking professional help is not an option for me as my mother’s disapproval towards even a hint of sadness deters any possibility of discussing mental health openly. I feel insignificant, convinced that others facing more severe challenges are more deserving of care than myself. Hearing about other people’s hardships only serves to amplify my sorrow and jealousy towards the affection they receive, an affection that has evaded me and likely always will. With limited avenues available, the urge to bring it all to an end looms large. Unfortunately, the internal barrier prevents me from inflicting even the smallest harm upon myself; the reason eludes me but remains an unyielding reality.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

I find myself resenting those who lead ordinary lives, and this envy morphs into a deep-seated hatred for anyone who diminishes my humanity. I perceive myself as subhuman, inherently useless and slothful, lacking the capacity to achieve anything worthwhile. Failure seems to be my only forte. Sometimes, I daydream about the bliss of ignorance, of being too unintelligent to comprehend the complexities of the world. Perhaps then, I could revel in simple joys without burdening myself with my inadequacies.\n\nSimilarly, while I covet what others possess, at the core, I resist becoming like them. The suffering seems to define me now; it's almost comforting in its familiarity. I yearn for more pain, a desire to be ridiculed and ostracized—a perpetual portrait of failure and disappointment. Nights shroud me in solitude, painting a picture of desolation akin to being the sole survivor on Earth—an eerie thought that both terrifies and entices me simultaneously. Despite this isolation, conversing with others holds no appeal; my disdain for humanity persists. Embracing fear seems fitting; every negative emotion appears justified. It's a realm where suffering is synonymous with existence—a landscape painted with needles for air and blood for sustenance.\n\nHope was never part of my narrative anyway. While others had pillars of support—be it family members, friends, or mentors—I have always trudged through life unaccompanied and continue to do so. The absence of friendship during formative years coupled with parental neglect has left me hollow witness to others' unbridled joy—a soul-crushing experience that leaves me feeling unworthy of having lived through those years at all. Vacant and adrift as if born anew each day—I stumble through existence void of purpose or direction—lacking scholastic prowess or social finesse.\n\nTangled in an addiction to junk food—my solace amidst chaos—I lay sprawled on the bed staring at ceilings that echo self-loathing chants within me: \"I hate myself\" reverberates endlessly like a broken record haunting every waking moment. Recent concerns about finances bring forth unease exacerbated by an ailment gnawing at my tailbone—a physical manifestation mirroring the turmoil within.\n\nWeighted down by self-loathing and inertia, depression envelopes me till even drawing breath feels burdensome—a vicious cycle intertwining worthlessness with financial destitution further driving home the message: improvement is but a distant dream as brokenness defines my reality.\n\nCaught in this relentless loop where failure begets more failure—the well-intended encouragement from outsiders falls flat—it's a struggle painted in hues only understood by the one drowning in them—rendering any lifeline seemingly out of reach...even for Herculean strength would falter under such burdensome weight.'\n\n###\n\n","completion":" in"}

The desire to end this cycle of pain is consuming me, to the point where thoughts of ending my own life have become a grim certainty. It's as if the universe takes pleasure in turning moments of potential joy into deep wells of despair.\n\nI struggle with the contradictions in suicide prevention messages that insist on life being worth living and that suicide is not the solution.

It is frustrating that my struggles are exacerbated by feelings of anhedonia and apathy, making me feel disconnected from myself.

{"prompt":"Why is it that I ended up with such a difficult life in comparison to those around me? It's frustrating because I can't even seek solace without the fear of someone attributing my struggles to my own shortcomings and suggesting I just need to work harder, when in reality I am already putting in my best efforts. My challenges seem to stem from factors beyond my control. Life appears to be a bleak existence for many, while others seem to effortlessly thrive. The current scenario where people are working longer hours for diminishing returns seems solely driven by insatiable greed among the billionaire class. The quality of life enjoyed by a blue-collar worker in the 50s-70s surpasses that of a young professional today. As a man, finding genuine love feels like an uphill battle, and I face criticism when I try to set reasonable expectations (which are not based on appearance); all I desire is fairness, not some stereotypical ideal. Women seem to have the luxury of choice and opportunities while men are burdened with taking all the initiative (equality, right? \/s). I have endured bullying, harassment, and mistreatment throughout my life. My parents struggle to accept me for who I am because of our differing beliefs and without a supportive partner by my side, it feels like there's no way out. Adding to this is navigating the challenges imposed by South Asian Muslim culture (even in the Western world). Whenever I express my grievances, I am met with criticism, blame-shifting, and sometimes encounter individuals eager to kick me when I'm already down. It's evident that luck plays a dominant role in about 99% of one's life experiences; while hard work may lead to incremental progress, luck ultimately shapes our core destinies. Why did fate deal me such a challenging hand compared to those around me?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" in"}

The magnitude of one's anguish seems insignificant to others as long as you refrain from ending your life. Some individuals will go to great lengths to prolong someone's agony by compelling them to endure unbearable circumstances. Why is that? Improvement isn't always guaranteed either. I feel like an utter idiot. Yesterday was when I had planned to end it all but I ended up being too lazy and kept postponing it, and today, the same thing occurred again. Why can't I just go through with it? Every single day, not going through with it fills me with regret, so why does my mind persist in obstructing it?

I anticipate the predictable retort of \"if everything is devoid of meaning, then it's inconsequential that nothing holds significance.\" Yet, this does not offer solace. It does not spark a rebellious streak within me to embrace life whimsically, surrendering to fate until my final rest. The pervasive fixation society has on cultivating individuality and moral uprightness is wearisome. I reject the pressure to exude positivity, confidence, or assertiveness as I lack proficiency in these traits. If I possessed these attributes effortlessly, I would not covet them in the first place. My stance is clear: in a world where human nature allows for limitless variability, my choice is nonexistence. I aspire to be the forsaken pixel on a screen or the elusive puzzle piece never unearthed. Superficiality permeates every interaction; the obsessive interest in others' appearances sickens me.

The looming existence of paradise only adds to my torment; vanishing permanently seems unattainable as divine intervention bars such an escape. A premonition haunts me - my demise by 35 awaits, with 22 marking my threshold.

My family dynamics are strained, and my friendships are crumbling, adding to my distress. The uncertainty of what lies beyond mortality is the sole anchor holding me back from taking drastic action.

Initially, there was optimism that ADHD would fade during puberty, but reality proved much harsher. Instead of easing up, it worsened over time, transforming me into the stereotypical distracted and unmotivated individual often depicted in media. I found it challenging to engage socially and behave like a typical person after its onset. The accusations leveled against me back then were all true. Regrettably, influenced by my obsession with anime at the time, I did attempt inappropriate behaviors like peeking at girls' skirts. Consequently, I became isolated and labeled as peculiar due to my repeated behaviors like fixating on particular books or uttering statements that made sense only to me.\n\nDuring my middle school years, plagued by relentless bullying, I voiced for the first time that I wanted to end my life—a thought that has lingered ever since. The fear of losing people terrifies me more than meeting new individuals does because my behavior tends to drive others away unknowingly. Despite having numerous advantages such as being white, male, attending a private school with affluent parents who funded my education through college without incurring any debt - I squandered every opportunity handed to me. Instead of building a successful future with two university degrees in hand, I am left with qualifications that hold little prospect in the job market.\n\nLoneliness engulfs me; feeling like an outcast is a constant companion.

My unresolved anger issues have tarnished my relationships with loved ones, resulting in hurt and self-directed anger.

In my darkest moments, the thought of a fresh start, free from both mental anguish and physical pain, holds a strong allure.

I am constantly teetering on the precipice and primed to react explosively to the slightest inconvenience, regardless of the circumstances. I genuinely fear that this could eventually lead to severe harm to someone else, potentially resulting in my incarceration. Thus, I am torn between seeking help at an emergency room and requesting admission to a psychiatric ward or succumbing to the urge to end my life. While I am still contemplating my next move and have not yet left my residence, part of me believes it would be better for society if I were confined for the remainder of my days. With no family ties, there would be no one affected by my absence. As for financial concerns regarding treatment, it is an uncertainty.

My family is convinced that my desire to end my life stems solely from what transpired with my ex-partner. The weight of this unbearable agony, this relentless torment, is inexplicable. I am grappling with this profound internal suffering, unable to comprehend why this affliction has chosen me. It's true that my ex probably doesn't harbor any concern for me and remains indifferent to the hurtful actions she concealed from me. Perhaps that explicit video I stumbled upon was intentionally left for me to discover one day. Despite feeling enraged, with an urge to lash out at her deceit, I also find it hard to place blame on her. Learning about disturbing secrets involving my husband's inclination towards inappropriate behaviors has added another layer of distress.

I'm exhausted because deep down, I know the moral implications of these struggles - and yet, despite my best efforts to overcome them, they persist and worsen. Adding to the complexity is the dismissive stance taken by my family attributing it all to a failed relationship\/marriage on my part.

There's only one person I feel comfortable talking to, for reasons that even I don't fully understand.

The fear of economic recession resurfacing, unemployment looming again, all compounded by academic pressure is overwhelming me.

Is living in this suffocating, monotonous, dystopian reality even worth it? Should I consider ending everything now?

{"prompt":"I have prepared an exit bag. Strangely enough, the thought of actually going through with suicide has left me genuinely terrified this time. Let me be completely honest. Back when I was 15, I ingested 120 extra strength aspirin pills. According to WebMD, it was a potentially lethal amount. It seemed like a good idea back then. I vividly recall the yelling, the physical blows, the loss of hearing, the inability to stand, and the subsequent hospital trip. Fast forward to when I was 21, I bought a gun for the first time and meticulously researched how to aim it at my head to ensure that I wouldn't end up being one of the \"fortunate few\" who survive a gunshot wound to the head. The fear of pain got the best of me. Even after loading a round into the chamber, I failed to realize that the slide wasn't fully forward by just half an inch. So when I pulled the trigger, nothing happened. The prospect of agony unnerved me so much that upon realizing my mistake, I couldn't bring myself to try pulling the trigger again. Concerned loved ones were searching for me and aware of my self-endangering tendencies, which eventually led to my hospitalization.\n\nMore recently, I acquired some rope. It was strong enough to support my weight though initially I didn't think it would be necessary. After reading up on partial suspension hanging and ensuring correct positioning of the noose, I went ahead with my plan in an isolated location. However, despite tightening it securely and leaning into it as instructed, all that ensued was excruciating pressure in my head with no signs of losing consciousness approaching. Defeated, my face turned purple with blood vessels rupturing from strain. A full hanging proved too unbearable for me.\n\nPresently, everything is set up for an exit bag attempt. The meticulous preparation brought about no emotional response this time around - much like how things have unfolded in various life situations lately due to my evolving depression morphing into depersonalization over this past year.\n\nSwitching on that gas valve triggered panic as it roared much louder beside me than expected. Logically knowing that it shouldn't cause pain didn’t prevent an ache in my chest from creeping up regardless. Hastily turning off the gas left me sitting there in shock without a clear sense of how to react.\n\nAt this juncture, mixed emotions consume me as I understand that if executed correctly (which is indeed the case this time), this method should be foolproof. However, coming face-to-face with the reality that there isn't anyone left in my life whom I could draft a melodramatic suicide note for hurts somewhat deeply.\n\nAcknowledging that this is truly happening - matching my fears and intentions - feels surreal yet definite at once after battling these thoughts for so long until numbness took over every emotion within me.\n\nNow possessing what once felt like an elusive desire but now stands before me starkly real leaves me oscillating between feelings of isolation and unease. Unsure if I am seeking anything specific here or merely expressing myself amidst a blend of fear of failure alongside fear of death.\n\nRegret sweeps over me when realizing how unintentionally or intentionally over time through decisions and actions led away even those few individuals close to me inadvertently resulting in this overwhelming sense of loneliness and fatigue plaguing every fiber of my being\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}

{"prompt":"I'm overwhelmed by anxiety when I think about what lies ahead. Just trying to motivate myself to study for exams without breaking down is an immense challenge. My mental well-being throughout this school year has been extremely poor. Besides my parents, the only person I have spoken to sporadically is just one individual. There's a multitude of assignments I've failed to complete; it's a small miracle that I have a C- in my most challenging classes. Now, as I see all the unfinished work piling up before me, I've come to the realization that I won't be able to submit them as per the syllabus guidelines, which I didn't bother reading and states that no late work is accepted after our last test. The upcoming AP Biology exam on Thursday is looming over me. Despite using Quizlet for every test, my grade of C- is solely sustained by that habit since I haven't been paying attention all semester. The weight of it all is becoming unbearable. Although it's just a matter of enduring for another two weeks, it feels like an eternity. The ordeal of preparing for my previous AP exam last Thursday already feels like a blur of relentless studying and tearful nights. It's alarming how suicide has crossed my mind now when it never did throughout the past year and more. If it weren't for my parents, who implicitly demand excellence from me, I probably wouldn't care at all. They both recognize my intelligence, and so do I. However, they are unaware of how messed up my mental state truly is and has been for some time now. With age, I've noticed that my parents are increasingly discussing future plans - which college to attend, what major to pursue, and what career path to take - but the truth is, I am lost in uncertainty. That's something I've wanted to express for a while now: I am clueless and overwhelmed by complex thoughts that never occurred to me before. Instead of pondering weighty matters like these in the past year and amidst quarantine challenges, I was preoccupied with simply finding fleeting moments of happiness each day. My so-called 'friends' have drifted away from me and the activities that used to bring solace are now ineffective in lifting my spirits; it's devastating how these long-standing sources of comfort have suddenly crumbled away into uselessness. Where do I go from here? It feels pathetic venting about all these bottled-up issues as a 15-year-old here. Yes, there are countless posts about more profound struggles out there which makes me question the significance of it all - we all meet the same end eventually anyway, don't we?

The realization that my fiancé doesn't truly care has cemented this decision for me. While I am uncertain about the specifics, thoughts of obtaining a gun have crossed my mind as a means to an end. The pressure from my job has been unbearably taxing on my mental health, driving me towards thoughts of suicide. Despite our financial dependence on my job for survival, the weight of responsibility is crushing me. The constant criticism and feelings of inadequacy at work have only worsened my state of mind. I feel like a failure, and maybe that's how I'll always be remembered, but death seems like a welcome escape from it all.

He can focus solely on himself, and I can find peace in finally being free from this torment.\nToday, in a moment of raw vulnerability, I confessed to him about how my job is driving me towards suicidal thoughts and left me unable to function. Instead of offering understanding or comfort, he seemed indifferent and suggested speaking with his boss which only made me feel like more of an inconvenience. My mother's concern has always been centered on my failures rather than understanding the deep struggles of depression and suicidal tendencies that plague me.

Her inquiries about my low energy levels come across as accusatory rather than supportive.

I have reservations about opening up and participating in online sessions adds another layer of discomfort. At times, the weight of depression becomes unbearable and leads me to dark considerations.

Instead, they brushed it off and even went as far as accusing me of being a difficult and ungrateful child towards my well-intentioned but flawed parents.\n\nMy parents have continuously intimidated me and emotionally coerced me into retracting my statements against them.

{"prompt":"I can't shake off the events that occurred 7 months ago. Just to provide some context, I am currently 17 years old. The incident took place during a visit to a friend's lake house in April. I innocently hopped on a tire swing that was barely 2 feet above the ground, only to land flat on my back. Initially, I didn't notice any significant changes, but that night, I started feeling unwell and fatigued. However, it wasn't until a couple of days later back at home that things started feeling off – my head was constantly foggy and fuzzy.\n\nAfter about a week of experiencing these symptoms, I consulted my regular doctor who promptly diagnosed it as a concussion. Despite exhibiting none of the typical signs associated with concussions apart from the mental haziness, the condition persisted. Following this, I sought out a neurologist who attributed it to post-concussion syndrome. But here's the catch – aside from the fogginess in my head, none of the usual concussion symptoms were present.\n\nFeeling no relief from these consultations, I turned to a chiropractor for help with no avail. As summer drew to a close, I attempted to find solace in golfing but found no respite. Instead, my condition worsened as my head began feeling like it was filled with scalding water – an incredibly discomforting sensation. Determined to find relief, I consulted a naturopathic doctor versed in natural remedies who assured me he could alleviate all my symptoms.\n\nMultiple diagnostic tests were carried out – MRI scans, x-rays, and CT scans on various parts of my body – followed by visits to a concussion clinic which unfortunately yielded no positive outcomes. At my mother's suggestion, I tried CBD oil as well but found it exacerbated my discomfort as my head became increasingly inflamed.\n\nSeeking further opinions led me to another naturopathic doctor who recommended consultations with vision specialists; however, their assessments didn't raise any red flags. Additionally, a neurotransmitter test hinted at anxiety as the underlying cause and led me to start taking Cymbalta progressively increasing from 30mg to 60mg and back down again to 30mg.\n\nThe situation has left me feeling utterly despondent; despite exploring various treatment options and even addressing low vitamin D levels through supplements yielding no improvement on top of alarmingly high cortisol levels pointing towards stress levels comparable to being intensely pursued by something scary according to one doctor's analogy.\n\nThe array of distressing symptoms includes tightness in the face and neck area along with temples feeling constricted. A sensation akin to hot water coursing through my head causing immense discomfort also accompanies zapping feelings around the temples coupled with exacerbation whenever I rest my head against surfaces causing involuntary head movement.

How I long for someone who truly understands me and isn't afraid to be by my side – not the facade I present to the outside world, but the real me.

I feel trapped in a false sense of security where nothing seems real anymore; this feeling has always lingered within me. The inability to find a way to ease this pain or fix the situation is exhausting. Disturbing thoughts of inflicting harm on others haunt my mind inexplicably. The desire to experience violence or trauma for relief puzzles me, as such things are nightmares for anyone.\n\nI am tormented by the possibility that I may have experienced sexual assault before without recollection. I don't seek attention through these dark fantasies; rather, I crave validation that eludes me.

My mind spirals into questioning whether it's a cry for attention or if these distressing events actually occurred but were somehow forgotten.\n\nThe unsettling urge to self-diagnose with various ailments intensifies my mental anguish. Each passing moment spent fixating on illnesses plunges me deeper into despair and confusion over my own existence. I loathe myself and feel undeserving of any sympathy or support despite desperately needing it. In moments when hope flickers briefly before fading again, I wait patiently for a reprieve from this torment – only to inevitably plunge back into darkness.

{"prompt":"Seeking advice about dealing with a situation involving severe bullying. A close friend of mine is being relentlessly harassed by a woman whom she doesn't even know. This individual has not only been subjecting my friend to verbal abuse, including statements suggesting self-harm and threats of violence like 'do the world a favor and go kill yourself' and 'when I find you, it's going to be the end of you,' but she has also resorted to body-shaming my friend in various ways. Additionally, she has created manipulated images of my friend engaging in fabricated conversations to portray her in a negative light. Despite my friend's simple request for this person to stop, the harassment persists unabated for almost five days now. The harasser has gone as far as creating multiple Instagram accounts (17), phone numbers (7), and Facebook accounts (2) solely for the purpose of tormenting my friend, leading to severe emotional distress on her part. As a result, my friend is displaying signs of extreme fatigue and reluctance to engage in normal daily activities. Despite attempts to encourage her to eat well and participate in activities outside, she seems withdrawn and is not coping effectively with the situation. She feels overwhelmed and disheartened by the advice from law enforcement not to engage with the bully, which leaves her feeling defenseless. It is worth noting that this individual portrays herself as a person of authority by identifying as a reverend, therapist, witch, light worker, healer, and personal trainer - an ironic contradiction considering her abusive behavior. In light of these circumstances, I am considering publicizing her phone number(s) and Instagram handle(s) for accountability purposes but seek guidance on how best to address this issue legally.

{"prompt":"\"I am planning to end my life in a few hours. As November 14th approaches, so does my chosen time to depart this world. Since I began sharing here back in June, I gave myself ample opportunity to succeed, but it seems that success has eluded me. Every aspect of my existence has met with failure, leading to the disdain of my parents, the abandonment or loss of my family, and the absence of friends. In my mind, I harbored aspirations for a life that only a select few ever attain, knowing deep down that it was beyond my reach. Was suicide the only recourse left to me? It seems so. Perhaps I should never have been born in the first place; circumstances conspired to bring me into a world where illness and emptiness have been my constant companions for far too long. Now everything is coming to an end – my possessions, my wealth, my dreams – and soon, my life will follow suit. While others revel in celebrations filled with loved ones and gifts tomorrow, I will lie alone in my room with a fatal wound inflicted upon myself. As someone else lives out the very life I had yearned for, I will be no more, unseen and forgotten. The prospect doesn't sadden me; in fact, I welcome it eagerly.\"\n\n\"I wish there was an easier way to plan for one's own demise. The practical aspects of preparing for death are proving more burdensome than I imagined – not just emotionally but logistically as well. Despite having penned nearly twenty farewell notes, I know there will be no one around to read them. My room has been tidied up, unnecessary accounts closed down, and passwords documented for those that remain open; tomorrow, if possible, I intend to deplete my savings entirely.\n\nImagine being seventy years old and having to undertake all this meticulous groundwork – yet another reason why ending my life appeals so strongly to me... who would willingly subject themselves to such tasks in old age? Concerns linger over the fate of my possessions: envisioning my money benefiting charitable causes alongside valuable items like electronics brings me some solace as I have no family to inherit anything from me – a thought that doesn't trouble me at all. While mentally prepared for death on every level imaginable, a part of me still frets over the fate of what little wealth remains mine.\"\n\n\"Here's an interesting turn of events – looks like expulsion from school might be on the cards come tomorrow! Today was essentially about sabotaging myself deliberately by skipping state tests since tomorrow marks the day when I will take my own life. With a negligent approach towards coursework thus far leading up to this final act, facing expulsion seems only fitting; indeed, receiving what is deemed just feels somewhat gratifying at this point... perhaps these last days should be steeped in even more suffering.\"\n\n\"As Saturday approaches – the day designated for ending my own life – while part of me feels eager for release from this existence, contemplating how certain individuals close to me might not comprehend the reasons behind such a drastic decision weighs heavily on me as well.

{"prompt":"The situation seems to be deteriorating rapidly, and I'm unsure of how much longer I can endure this pain. Holding on feels like an impossible task at this point. Despite knowing that I shouldn't feel this way, I simply can't help it. My childhood was marred by constant bullying and mistreatment, not just from peers but even from some teachers who turned a blind eye or even encouraged the abuse. My mother has made it abundantly clear that she prioritizes her boyfriend over me, often threatening to cast me aside during our arguments. The few family members, friends, and supportive teachers I once had are no longer a part of my life – they've either left or passed away, leaving me feeling utterly isolated. The few remaining friends who show genuine care are dealing with their own challenges; one is battling illness while the other is preoccupied with their commitments to online schooling. This leaves me largely on my own during the week, a state which sometimes feels like the only respite despite its loneliness. It's true that being alone offers some solace, yet when surrounded by people, negative situations seem to find me effortlessly, breeding unkind thoughts within me. Although I am just a high school senior with time on my side, the toxic environment around me constrains any possibility of escape or seeking help. Previous attempts to seek support from school have only worsened matters and my mother shows little interest in providing access to therapy – especially if she cannot oversee or control the conversations happening there. Financial constraints and lack of employment further hinder any prospects of self-initiated therapy sessions. Constant ridicule from my mother and her partner for my interests and actions only add to the existing burden; should they discover my friendships, they would likely go to great lengths to sabotage them as well. While acknowledging my imperfections and past missteps, the perpetual cycle of pushing away those who care about me feels deeply unjust – I don't believe I deserve such isolation. With very little to cling onto in life except for my two cherished friends, suicide seems like an increasingly viable option in moments of desperation. The prospect of enduring another year in such agony while recognizing the need for help feels overwhelmingly burdensome – a reality I never envisioned reaching this level of severity. In a moment of bleak resolve, I've even contemplated ending everything on graduation night if things fail to improve; however grim that thought may be, attending graduation holds no appeal as it symbolizes nothing but further alienation and rejection in my eyes...I am consumed by a profound desire to escape this anguish through drastic means.\"Situations continue spiraling downwards relentlessly.\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

I've even contemplated strategically timing potentially fatal encounters with the loud neighbor’s sports car as they leave for work or other engagements (though quickly dismissed such options out of concern for causing them trauma). Managing how to carry out my intentions without being interrupted by family members has also crossed my mind. Perhaps unwittingly, brainstorming ways to end my life has become almost like a pastime during quarantine. The catalyst behind this incessant desire to die escapes me now, but currently, it boils down to self-loathing – plain and simple. No matter how hard I try, loving myself seems beyond reach. While admiration for others comes effortlessly due to their inherent humanity which makes them remarkable in my eyes, extending that same grace towards myself feels inconceivable. Fool. Failure. Coward. Useless. Disgraceful. Broken. Hypocritical. Emotionally paralyzed. Immature adult. Worthless investment – these are just some of the demeaning labels that inundate me at moments of vulnerability which seem endless lately.\n\nAlthough many insist that time will heal these wounds, I find little solace in their reassurances despite their earnest efforts. If anything, their concern only amplifies the guilt I feel for causing distress where none should exist; convinced that I am unworthy of their attention or efforts on my behalf.\n\nSeeking professional intervention became an option but proved financially unfeasible for sustained therapy sessions; likewise, medication efficacy dwindled over time and upscale alternatives were economically out of reach within our locale.\n\nMultiple endeavours and once-treasured passions have all lost their luster especially after enduring the profound loss earlier this year when my mother passed away – leaving me consumed by anxiety and self-revulsion ever since.\n\nThe prospect of making her proud was what lit the path ahead before her untimely demise but now that she's gone, guilt gnaws at me (while refraining from disclosing specifics to safeguard confidentiality). Former coping mechanisms may have offered respite previously yet now seem powerless against the relentless tide overtaking me.\n\nPresently gripped by contemplations of suicide with detailed plans at hand along with varied means to carry them out; surrender seems an easier route albeit one too forgiving for someone responsible for inflicting immeasurable pain on others.\n\nI don't believe I merit the liberation death offers nor do those who’ve suffered due to me deserve such an easy exit either; henceforth enduring seems more appropriate punishment fitting someone who's caused so much harm.\n\nAlthough uncertain if this reasoning adequately dissuades me from self-harm entirely; it serves as a makeshift anchor holding fast amidst tumultuous seas thus far.\n\nScribbling these words without clear intent or expectation merely stemmed from idle browsing amidst habitual ideation prompting a detour into this subreddit where threads mirrored fragments of myself resonated keenly.\n\nContributing to this discourse felt like a way to make sense of internal chaos present within suicidal contemplations – not necessarily seeking guidance as doubts linger regarding others’ capacity to comprehend despite genuine intentions; hindered chiefly by my own struggles articulating personal turmoil accurately.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

Maybe \"criticizing\" isn't the perfect term, but while I was venting about my parents, he was trying to explain why I might be overreacting. Honestly, he was spot on, but his disagreement made me feel incredibly anxious, like he was launching an attack on me.

Once I have my own place, regardless of whether I do or not, I can finally pursue what I truly want. The idea of ending my life through self-harm or suicide seems like a way to escape the overwhelming feelings of depression, fear, regret, and worthlessness that have consumed me. Sometimes it seems like the world would be better off without me. I berate myself for failing in my senior year and for longing for love and care from a family that only brings toxicity, manipulation, cruelty, and insincerity. There are moments when I wish I had never been born. I find myself waiting for the end to come, yearning to fade away in solitude and coldness. It's likely that no one would discover my body until the bills pile up after months of isolation. If I manage to isolate myself enough, my passing may go unnoticed indefinitely. It feels like no one will remember me once I'm gone. This self-loathing consumes me entirely. I am overwhelmed with sadness and a deep desire for assistance, yet at the same time, I am paralyzed by fear—fear of reaching out for help and fear of facing my own emotions head-on.

Yet, the idea of suicide continues to consume my thoughts relentlessly.

This fear is compounded by the fact that I am unprepared in various aspects. Nevertheless, I find myself unable to focus on anything else except revisiting the notion of attempting suicide again.

{"prompt":"I suffered abuse during my childhood at the hands of my parents, and unfortunately, I still reside with them as an adult due to my current circumstances. Despite having reached out to the authorities in the past about the abuse, they were skeptical and dismissed my claims since I lacked concrete evidence. Instead, they portrayed me as a rebellious and unappreciative adolescent to my well-intentioned yet flawed parents. Through bullying and emotional manipulation, my parents coerced me into retracting my accusations and convinced me that I was actually the aggressor while they were innocent victims – a narrative that I regrettably came to believe and tearfully apologized for. Feeling immense self-hatred for falling for their tactics, I find myself silenced by the threat of jeopardizing my safety or even my life should I dare to take legal action against them. The coercion to keep quiet about their abusive behavior is slowly chipping away at me, and sharing this here is currently my only outlet. Seeking professional help is not an option for me at the moment, and to make matters worse, my parents are actively impeding any attempts I make towards moving out.

All I crave is the stability of a job that would allow me to participate actively in society and give me a sense of purpose. The longing to engage with new people and explore new places is overwhelming. Being confined indoors day in and day out, hoping for a miraculous change tomorrow, is wearing me down. I don't despise life itself, but rather this stagnant existence that offers no progression. It feels like everyone around me is flourishing with fulfilling jobs, meaningful relationships, and independent living situations while I remain stuck in the same childhood home. This static state of affairs is suffocating me. Despite my innate melancholy disposition, deep down, I yearn to embrace life's possibilities - financial stability, companionship, interests to pursue - and witness where these paths may lead. However, at every step forward, it seems like the universe pushes back against me with greater force.

I sense that she expects me to be flawless, without any issues, and on a path to immense success whether it's what I want or not.

Over the past two years, ever since returning to my home country (Romania), I have been overwhelmed by stress, mainly stemming from school back in 2019. I struggled to make friends, cried myself to sleep most weeks, and even activities I used to enjoy seemed dull. Thoughts of ending my own life crossed my mind numerous times, but the love I have for my little brother prevented me from acting on them. Throughout the pandemic, things slightly improved as I still battled anxiety but gained a supportive friend who listened and made a difference in my life.\nThe reason for me sharing this now is because everything has worsened significantly. Stress and anxiety have become paralyzing; I lack the drive to engage in anything. Also, last year I came to terms with being atheistic and bisexual. Unfortunately, my family and friends are deeply religious, making it challenging for me. Recently, I confided in my only friend about my identity, but now he's distanced himself from me. He was my only confidant and the person with whom I conversed regularly.\nI am carrying all these burdens within me, fearing that if I disclose them to anyone familiar, they will dismiss it as 'just a phase' or belittle my struggles by saying, 'you're just a kid; what do you have to worry about?'

Oddly enough, commercials seem to trigger my depression. The sounds, the music, the voices - they all culminate in a way that affects me deeply. It must be linked to some unresolved issues from my past, but pinpointing the exact cause is challenging.\n\nLiving a life you never chose is draining. Tonight marks my first attempt at sleeping sober in three months, and the urge to end everything only grows stronger. My mind races incessantly, preventing any chance of sleep.

There hasn't been a specific trigger for my continual struggle with depression and thoughts of suicide; it has simply been a lingering presence for as far back as I can remember. Despite trying various prescribed medications, seeking counseling, staying active and healthy, easily making friends, and actively engaging in new experiences to seek out a sense of purpose in life, the shadow of my suicidal thoughts has often clouded my judgment. While many aspects of my life have generally been positive, there have been instances where these thoughts have led me to sabotage any progress or even contemplate ending my own life. This feeling of despair has become an overwhelming part of my identity, one that used to frighten me but now leaves me feeling utterly detached and apathetic towards everything around me.\n\nThis sense of detachment and emotional numbness has persisted for the past few years, making it increasingly difficult for me to find any motivation or reason to continue living. I've grown accustomed to this constant state of misery, acknowledging deep down that it's not how things should be but struggling to envision any alternative way of thinking. Despite being able to maintain decency in my interactions, perform well at work, and form meaningful relationships both platonic and romantic in nature, none of these achievements seem to make the effort worthwhile anymore. I feel like I'm at the end of my rope both figuratively and literally as I grapple with the terrifying prospect of ending my own life.\n\nLiving has come to feel like an empty existence despite my past social successes and accomplishments. It's becoming increasingly challenging to view daily activities as anything other than burdens to bear rather than experiences to enjoy. Currently residing under someone else's roof following a recent hospitalization, the future seems bleak as impending bills loom over me without any financial means to address them. The temptation to end it all is growing stronger by the day, though fear of the physical pain involved prevents me from taking that final step.\n\nDespite attempting different methods like partial suspension hanging without success due to persistent fears regarding potential pain from another failed attempt on my life, I find myself contemplating more drastic measures such as a full short drop hanging or obtaining a firearm through a job interview process that holds little promise beyond financial gain. The allure of escaping the mental anguish through depersonalization becomes increasingly enticing as feelings of numbness pervade every aspect of my being.\n\nStruggling with depression throughout my life has now evolved into this unsettling depersonalization phase that robs me of any sense of desire or purpose.

Though my loved ones may wish for me to persist, it feels selfish to do so solely for their sake.

Your relationship with your parents might be strained, either feeling unloved or smothered by their affections. You might have even thought about turning to drugs or alcohol to numb the stress.

The challenges escalated when I started university - no friends, social anxiety, lack of motivation, and depression turned me into a recluse. Venturing out of my dorm only for meals, I began falling further behind academically and eventually failed in my second year. This marked a turning point as I turned to drugs, chasing that initial high with various substances. Experimenting recklessly with different drug combinations, including nitrous oxide balloons, took a toll on my mental health.

Following these experiences, there were several suicide attempts that weren't severe enough to warrant hospitalization but left me delusional.

As third year began, I briefly tried to change but quickly relapsed into destructive habits, culminating in a final LSD trip and a serious suicide attempt. Following this incident, I had a prolonged psychotic episode that resulted in hospitalization; upon release, university strongly advised me to take time off. Instead of heeding their advice, I attempted assignments despite knowing they were beyond my capability which led to another severe suicide attempt that should have landed me back in the hospital.\\n\\nAfter being discharged yet again and miraculously passing exams despite everything, I still failed the year due to failing first semester exams and second semester assignments.

Despite working diligently to obtain a degree and escape my hometown in Appalachia with hopes of pursuing a career in software engineering, things have not gone as planned. The job I initially secured altered the role significantly after I joined, boxing me into a position that felt like a nightmare. With limited connections from university, I managed to secure another job, but I am skeptical about being able to find another one if needed. Making several mistakes right from the start - missing emails, procrastinating on HR paperwork - has put me in a precarious position with my current boss, who expressed strong dissatisfaction towards me.

The fear of losing this job looms large as it directly impacts my ability to cover rent. Acclimating to a new city without any friends or social support adds to the strain, and my lack of romantic relationships for years stems partly from insecurities about my appearance which admittedly doesn't bother me much.

{"prompt":"I am experiencing deep feelings of loneliness. This sentiment has been a constant companion throughout my life, starting from the days I endured bullying in kindergarten, where I struggled to forge meaningful friendships. Even the playmates in my neighborhood seemed to engage with me solely because of my brother's presence. As I progressed through grade school, it became apparent that few people were interested in being my friend. High school offered a glimmer of hope as I began forming connections, only to watch them fade away over time. Though I find solace in the company of my cousins, I often feel like an outsider among them, believing that they would prefer my absence. The lingering sense of being a burden to those around me weighs heavily on my heart.\n\nPresently, I have just one close friend who also happens to be an ex-teacher of mine. In moments of despair, I have contemplated self-harm on three occasions but could not bring myself to follow through each time. This perceived inability to act leaves me grappling with feelings of cowardice and self-disgust. The haunting image of my family discovering me lifeless in a pool of blood torments my thoughts.\n\nUnfortunately, confiding in my mother is not an option since she holds the belief that individuals who take their own lives are lacking in strength. While my siblings have tried to reassure me that suicide is never a solution, the urge within me persists as a tempting escape route from this overwhelming emotional turmoil.

{"prompt":"I desperately need assistance; I feel completely overwhelmed. Following a sexual assault, my family's invalidation of my experience amplifies my sense of sexual vulnerability and triggers me immensely. The pain and frustration run deep, and the desire to escape it all is overpowering. Despite my efforts to save myself, the feeling of being trapped persists as I navigate through interactions with those who have caused me such trauma. It seems inevitable that I must endure staying at their home until January 19th, a prospect that fills me with dread. The overwhelming sense of helplessness is compounded by the dynamics at home where my mother's religious fervor takes center stage, focusing all attention on my Autistic sister while leaving me feeling neglected.\n\nAdding to this turmoil are the lingering effects of other traumatic experiences within my family. Enduring mistreatment and being coerced into financial obligations while struggling with a low-paying job has taken a toll on my mental well-being. Meanwhile, watching my sister receive undue favor despite her lack of ambition only adds to my distress. Expressing my emotions is met with resistance, with any sign of burdensomeness causing hurt feelings from my mother rather than support.\n\nThe weight of past traumas is further exacerbated by encounters in my academic environment where I find myself surrounded by an overwhelmingly vocal left-leaning community. Their tendency to assign blame to broad social groups based on race or affiliation is alienating, especially as someone with moderate leftist views witnessing the toxicity of such rhetoric firsthand among younger peers who fail to comprehend differing perspectives.\n\nThe missed opportunities for a normal life due to family circumstances compound the sense of injustice I feel. Reflecting on how parental decisions impacted crucial life choices like pursuing higher education only adds bitterness to the mix. Being asked to forgo college plans due to parental circumstances and loyalty feels like a sacrifice that weighs heavily on me, overshadowing any semblance of personal agency or fulfillment.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

The situation has escalated to the point where this individual has not only been tormenting my friend with vicious comments like 'you should just end your life' and 'I will make sure it's the last thing you do,' but has also resorted to relentless body-shaming. Furthermore, she has resorted to creating manipulated images depicting my friend engaging in fabricated conversations with her and others, seemingly in an attempt to tarnish her reputation.\n\nDespite my friend's simple plea for the harassment to cease, this woman persists, unleashing her vitriol through a staggering array of 17 Instagram accounts, 7 different phone numbers, and 2 separate Facebook profiles. The unrelenting nature of these attacks is taking a toll on my friend's mental well-being, leaving her constantly fatigued and disinterested in basic self-care activities. Encouragements to eat properly or engage in social outings are met with resistance as she appears overwhelmed by the incessant bullying. The fact that authorities have advised against any direct response has only added to her sense of helplessness, exacerbated by the perceived lack of agency in defending herself.\n\nIn a twisted irony, the perpetrator behind these vicious acts presents herself as a figure of virtue - a self-proclaimed reverend, therapist, witch, lightworker, healer, and even a personal trainer. The incongruity of this portrayal only adds insult to injury.\n\nGiven these circumstances, I am compelled to seek advice on whether publicizing this woman's phone number(s) or Instagram handle(s) would aid in delivering some form of justice for my friend.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" in"}

Believing in \"my body, my choice,\" I struggle with the unfairness of being deprived of the decision to end my life while being left to cope with this constant turmoil internally. It's disheartening how this feeling seems to spread to others around me; their efforts to lift my spirits often backfire, plunging them into melancholy as well. Despite being on medication, my severe depressive disorder remains resistant to treatment. The fleeting moments of happiness I've experienced in recent years have been achieved by altering my perception of reality just to keep intrusive thoughts at bay.

For a whole year, my mind was consumed by thoughts about the insignificance of everything after death and the overall futility of existence. Despite the absence of any specific reasons in my current situation prompting suicidal thoughts, I am haunted by this lingering sense that ending my life is somehow warranted.

{"prompt":"I have prepared an exit bag. This is the first time that the notion of taking my own life has truly frightened me. I'll just be completely honest. Back when I was 15, I ingested 120 extra strength aspirin pills. According to WebMD, it was a potentially fatal dose. It seemed like a good idea at the time. I remember the yelling, the slapping, the deafness, the inability to stand, and the subsequent hospital visit that followed. When I turned 21, I acquired a gun. It was my first experience handling one. After extensive research on aiming it at my head to ensure instant fatality, I found out where to aim precisely. The thought of the pain unsettled me greatly, and even after loading a round into the chamber, I unknowingly left the slide slightly open by about half an inch. Consequently, when I pulled the trigger, nothing happened. The fear of pain overwhelmed me to such an extent that upon realizing my error, I couldn't bring myself to try pulling the trigger again. People were searching for me as they knew I posed a danger to myself, which eventually led to my hospitalization.\n\nNot long ago, I procured some rope. It was sturdy enough to support my weight although initially I didn't think it would need to be that strong. Researching partial suspension hanging methods, I believed I had positioned the noose correctly and adhered to all guidelines meticulously. At a secluded spot, I proceeded with my plan. However tightly secured or how much pressure was applied on it, all that ensued was intense pain and head pressure without any signs of losing consciousness. Discouraged and with my face purple and blotchy from bursting blood vessels under pressure, it became evident that full hanging was beyond what I could endure.\n\nToday marks another attempt with an exit bag arranged meticulously as part of a routine that seems almost detached from any emotional response just like in any life situation so far.I observed my lifelong depression metamorphosing into depersonalization over recent years which has left me feeling exceedingly hollow - so utterly devoid of everything.\n\nYet when it came down to turning on that gas valve today; panic ensued as it hissed louder than expected next to my ear: Despite knowing it shouldn't hurt or effect discomfort—I felt an ache in my chest nonetheless.I hastily shut off gas flow and sat there in a bewildered state unable comprehend what comes next.At this juncture,I feel lost,navigating uncontemplated feelings,stuck between loneliness and anxiety without clear direction or action plan.I'm unsure what exactly these words mean or serve here,but deep worry exists within failing this attempt combined with an inherent fear tied closely with death also occupies space within.I'm saddened by recent actions both intentional and unintentional pushing away those few close individuals left in my life- leaving me feeling isolated with profound exhaustion lingering in every crevice within me\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}

The skills I possess seem inadequate, and the requirement for job references and constant excellence is disheartening. Despite multiple attempts, I struggle to meet these expectations or even navigate through interviews smoothly. The thought of being stuck in this relentless cycle is unbearable. The pressure to perform well in job roles coupled with financial concerns weighs heavily on me. The cost of living and housing situation particularly frustrate me. I find myself easily brought to tears, unable to assert myself when faced with unfair treatment which seems too frequent. Even the preparation for work fills me with dread as I feel trapped in this competitive environment where suicide appears as the only escape route.\n\nAside from these challenges, my current financial situation looms large as a pressing issue. Feelings of inadequacy persist as I struggle to secure references and lack motivation or memory retention skills. There's a profound disinterest in engaging with anything productive or speaking in a professional manner despite efforts to improve through observing videos.\n\nThe inability to articulate responses smoothly accompanied by awkward pauses during interactions adds to my embarrassment and deep sense of emptiness under the weight of life's demands at 22 years old. The mounting difficulties only exacerbate my fear and contemplation of drastic measures like hanging, although carrying them out seems insurmountable. Venting these thoughts periodically on platforms like this is my attempt at coping with the overwhelming negativity surrounding me.\n\nAn incident involving ridicule from a colleague recently further emphasizes my struggles to form meaningful connections or friendships due to my social awkwardness and heightened sensitivity. Despite not actively seeking companionship, the absence of close relationships affects me profoundly.\n\nReflecting on the world's cruelty - from malicious individuals to societal pressures, employment constraints, judgmental attitudes, and escalating violence - reinforces the notion of an escape route though summoning the courage proves elusive.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

Sleep eludes me as my mind races uncontrollably—this agony is unbearable.\n\nWhen people ask if I'm okay and then proceed to hijack the conversation by talking only about themselves, it adds to the frustration. It's maddening how sharing suicidal thoughts briefly lifts my spirits until I consider an actual plan to carry it out—a chilling paradox.\n\nConsidering medication for depression raises uncertainties—I fear becoming numb or emotionally vacant while existing like a walking corpse is not appealing either. The world feels unwelcoming and lonely; life seems devoid of purpose or meaning.\n\nAt 29, attempting a genuine relationship for the first time ended in heartbreak—you invest everything only to be abandoned for others after promising forever. Crying on breaks at work yearning for her companionship underscores the emotional turmoil endured alone.\n\nSeeking solace from supposed friends results in clichéd advice about hotlines or therapy instead of genuine empathy or conversation. Opening up to family promises chaos, so silence becomes the norm—an isolating experience further pushing me towards despair.\n\nThis world feels unbearable; life appears meaningless and hopeless—I long to detach from it all sooner rather than later.

A disagreement with my long-term boyfriend escalated unexpectedly after what I believed was a harmless question. Although past arguments have usually ended on a positive note, this one concluded on a sour tone, almost as if to say, let's just forget this ever happened. Throughout our relationship, we have shared dreams of a future together, but now doubts linger in my mind about its feasibility. The bond we shared feels strained this time around. I cherished him deeply and considered myself fortunate to have him in my life. Feeling lost, I find myself drifting aimlessly, indifferent to whatever may come our way. The unintentional infliction of hurt weighs heavily on me; I bear the guilt of causing pain to someone I deeply care for. The happiness and fulfillment I found in our relationship now seem overshadowed by the pain of unintended offenses and hurtful words exchanged during this fallout.

Well, not according to my family – now they've crowned me the epitome of worthlessness. My academic performance has suffered, driving them to anger and branding me as a failure and letdown. Opening up to them about my struggles, including feelings of cowardice and suicidal thoughts, falls on deaf ears. Their focus remains solely on my grades and household chores. Being berated as lazy and worthless while witnessing my grades plummet fuels their prophecy that I'll never make it to college. I'm weary of trying to meet their expectations; thoughts of finding a painless way out have consumed me for over six months now, though I've yet to discover a solution.

Instead of trying to better myself, all I seem capable of is frustrating those who perhaps wish for my well-being. But deep down, I don't want to get better; at least that's what I tell myself. The idea of getting better seems undeserved - all I think I deserve is a quick end, maybe a bullet to end it all. My default setting is to whine about how miserable everything is but have I ever truly attempted to change things for the better? No, reaching out for companionship feels pointless because in the end, isn't it just me drowning in self-pity and worry?\n\nI acknowledge that my existence has become burdensome over time, and sometimes the thought crosses my mind that maybe it would be easier if someone just extinguished me like the pathetic mess that I am.

In my eyes, what defines me is this monstrous version staring back in the mirror, as if depression has somehow become a part of who I am because well...maybe deep down, it’s what I deserve. Admitting how much I've failed not only solidifies it for myself but also for those observant enough around me.

Chronic depression, a family trait, has stripped me of my essence, leaving me devoid of charm and sociability. Suggestions like \"work on your personality\" or \"put yourself out there\" miss the mark entirely as depression renders me unappealing in every aspect. While not always at the forefront, the pain creeps up now and then, making death seem like a solace.

Every day is a struggle against an overwhelming desire to just cease existing. The routine grind of an unfulfilling job offers no respite.

Suggestions to explore new avenues only aggravate the inner turmoil as my energy drains away without respite. Feelings of intellectual inadequacy plague every endeavor, reinforcing a sense of worthlessness that overshadows any glimmer of hope.\n\n- Life exhausts me beyond measure, and all efforts seem futile in yielding any returns. Academic pursuits fall short despite relentless studying; physical endeavors leave me lagging behind despite consistent effort; social interactions come off as awkward due to my inner numbness and incessant negativity weighing me down.

An openness about suicidal thoughts would offer solace for many who find themselves trapped in this numbing abyss. Severe depression coupled with anhedonia leaves little room for aspiration towards a brighter future; maintaining stable employment seems an insurmountable challenge compounded by perceived intellectual limitations and lack of perceived attractiveness – subjective though it may be according to societal standards set by some idealized image-making fashion models elitist gatekeeping prevents engagement with others on any meaningful level.\n\n- Depression taints even the simplest joys in life with its senseless shades capturing video games before casting them aside swiftly into boredom’s abyss lacks hope or anticipation tired tropes urging experimentation fail precipitating further frustration when held against insurmountable depression undermining such attempts at improvement])->\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

The constant feeling of being utterly useless weighs heavily on me; it's almost like my only role is that of a mere errand runner. Not being able to fit into the norms due to being trans only adds another layer of failure in my eyes. The desperation has led me to consider starving myself as a way out, viewing it as a slower and less painful alternative to hanging myself - although having access to a gun seems like a more efficient and less agonizing option.

It's not exactly that I'm eager to live, but there are plans in motion, particularly with a pending move that I don't want to abandon after investing money into it only to meet a tragic end right after. However, failing this test seems unbearable. The window for the right opportunity has closed, my medication is out of reach, there's no suitable place to jump from, and even the blades I used for self-harm no longer seem effective enough. It's as though, for perhaps the first time ever, I'm on the verge of contentment; engaging in setting up my new room brings some form of joy and anticipation for future projects and endeavors – though it might just be my manic tendencies resurfacing. It almost feels like I have a sense of purpose or direction. Currently, things are relatively stable, and I wish to continue this positive momentum.

{"prompt":"I find it deeply troubling, but I lack the courage to act on it. I am currently on a work placement and once this six-month period ends, I feel lost about my future. I believe I lack the necessary skills, and the pressure of needing references for job applications and constantly having to excel at work weighs heavily on me. Despite my repeated efforts, I struggle to meet these expectations. Even a simple job interview is a daunting task for me. The continuous cycle of feeling inadequate for roles and the pressing need for money is overwhelming. The high cost of living and confusing housing system in the UK add to my distress. I am extremely sensitive and find it challenging to assert myself when faced with unfair treatment, which seems to be a recurring theme in my life.\n\nThe routine of preparing for work fills me with dread, and I feel trapped in a relentless pursuit that resembles a rat race. Thoughts of suicide creep into my mind as I see no way out of this situation. While there are other underlying issues, my current financial struggles take center stage as I fear facing more hardships. Doubts about my intelligence and the lack of positive references contribute to my feelings of inadequacy.\n\nMy proactive nature is lacking, and my memory often fails me. The disinterest in anything coupled with an inability to communicate professionally despite efforts to learn through videos and observation exacerbates my distress. Embarrassment washes over me during formal interactions as pauses fill my responses, highlighting my shortcomings.\n\nAs this heaviness lingers within me, the challenges grow more immense as I navigate through being 22 years old where everything feels increasingly arduous. The weight of these burdens feels suffocating, leaving me filled with fear and uncertainty.\n\nThoughts of hanging cross my mind, yet carrying them out remains beyond reach as I seek solace in sharing my thoughts here periodically to shed light on the bleakness of the world around me. Recently experiencing belittlement from a coworker only adds to this sense of isolation. Struggling to connect with others leaves me devoid of friendships; although not actively seeking companionship, this void impacts me nevertheless.\n\nNavigating social interactions proves complex due to my awkwardness heightened by a deep sensitivity towards others' perceptions. Contemplations on the world's cruelty - encompassing greed, employment pressures, societal expectations, harsh judgments, violence - make escape seem tempting yet unattainable due to a lack of resolve within me.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

The only person who has truly supported me through all this pain is my girlfriend, whom my family doesn't approve of.

The labels I inflict upon myself - fool, letdown, coward, lazy oaf, burden, failure, flawed goods - echo loudly especially during moments of vulnerability which currently feel unendingly commonplace. People often reassure me that this phase will pass; however, as much as their efforts are appreciated, these feelings persist stubbornly.\n\nDespite confiding in friends and family who valiantly strive to convince me otherwise about the irrationality of these thoughts, if anything, it exacerbates my anguish knowing how much distress I cause them needlessly. Their concern only reinforces my belief that I am not worth their time or efforts.\n\nWhile seeking professional assistance is an option, the exorbitant costs make regular visits unfeasible coupled with diminishing returns from medications due to financial constraints on stronger prescriptions only deepen this despair.\n\nEarlier this year marked a significant loss with the passing of my mother which left me hollow except for anxiety and self-reproach; striving to make her proud was once all that motivated me but now her absence amplifies guilt which remains unspoken due to concealment concerns.\n\nPreviously reliable coping methods no longer offer solace in this period particularly following these recent events. The weight of agony grows heavier by day driving me closer towards contemplating ending it all despite having outlined numerous means to achieve this release but stopping short each time due to an innate sense that death is too swift an escape and far too merciful given the pain inflicted upon others because truly understanding souls opt for departure whereas culpability binds mine keeping me tethered here enduring as just retribution though unsure whether this rationale suffices as reason enough against fatal resolve.\n\nMy intentions in sharing these thoughts are unclear even unto myself; perhaps seeking solace among fellow redditors experiencing similar struggles led me here searching for solidarity within shared experiences despite waning faith in well-intentioned guidance rendered futile by words failing adequately encapsulate complexities shrouding personal torment plaguing unrealized miseries lurking beneath surface appearances gauged inaccurately by external perceptions challenging accurate expression through abbreviated posts like this as futile attempt contributing something meaningful yet elusive satisfaction remains as sought after revelation amidst prevailing doubts obscuring clarity needed amidst desolation enveloping every waking moment growing clouded progressively with dwindling hope fading into obscurity destined shadows lingering ever-present casting doubt upon resolved perseverance struggling against encroaching darkness enveloping fragile mind teetering edge brink ceaseless agony.echoes cacophony resounding silence broken reticence understated suffering screams silent struggle endured stoically weathered facade disintegrates fractured remnant semblance once retained disguise tenuous resolves crumble yielding essence laid bare fragility exposed raw nerves frayed unraveling spirals breath fleeting linger embrace cold embrace void solace long-awaited respite offered denied endlessly prolonged insufferable endurance defies frail aspirations futile endeavors taking aim fulfilling visions never realized surrender apathetic stasis holding breath exhale finality embraces lovingly welcoming demise uncertainties vanished exchanged solemn certainty embraced eternal sleep beckons peacefully mocking lingering doubts weakening hold tenebrous doubts corroding frail resistance crumbling resolute mythaly pleaded acceptance relenting grim inevitability concluding gentle whisper lifelines hours waning defiant flickering flames engulfed consuming pyres rekindling lost hopes new beginning consumed ashes departing shadows receding into oblivion resisting submission succumbs tender seduction whisper benevolent relinquishment ensnaring soul fleeting tranquilityescape inevitable brutality clutches grasp relinquished despair munificent purgatory released spirit soaring free.finalmente alivio infame conando dulce beso muerte.consume impureza durmiente final prometida apagón hecho brillar epitafios convocado póstumo moobs destino tan mostraban arduas cicatrizar jaulas huesos frágiles danzan contenido desespíritu cautivo músicos deben cerrar cortina rendición melodía entrecortada interludio derrumbándose furor entregado acallando silenciosa batalla.inminente demencia susurra pasillos tiempos capturados eclipsados claroscuros relucen penumbras reflejadas rostros callaron tiempo olvidaron sombras huidizas abrazan acogedoramente mentiras vívidas enterradas renacidas matices borradas solaz esperanzas naufragio perdido principio consumidas cenizas partiendo partenigos refugiointangible sombra brillantez desvanecidos resistiendo sumisión cede seducción suspira entregado pasajerosía huidaíaliberación inevitable brutalidad garras se aferran marchándola cede dispuesto persiguiendo certeza instantes últim\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

A few weeks back, she bluntly stated her certainty that I would eventually commit suicide, even mentioning she would bet on it if given the chance. I was caught off guard and unsure how to react. My attempt at lightening the mood with a joke fell flat, followed by a brief mention of my ongoing battle against my mental health issues before changing topics. However, her words have been weighing heavily on me since then, leaving me feeling deeply hurt and questioning her faith in me. If she had concerns about my well-being, couldn't she have expressed them differently, without such harshness? It seems unlikely that if faced with a cancer diagnosis instead of battling Borderline Personality Disorder and Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, she would have made similar comments about my chances of survival. The insensitivity and pain caused by her words have altered my perception of our relationship, making it difficult for me to engage with her as before. She has reached out to spend time together (considering we are in the same COVID bubble), but I am unsure how to address the issue without sparking conflict. Those around me are accustomed to me avoiding confrontation and speaking up when I'm unhappy typically leads to negative reactions. Do I have valid reasons for feeling wounded and distressed by this situation or am I possibly blowing it out of proportion? What steps should I take next?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

The disappearance of those I once conversed with has left me isolated, unable to forge any meaningful bonds with others. Presenting a facade of normalcy while internally deteriorating is becoming increasingly challenging. The breakdown of my car feels like an unwelcome obstacle prolonging my suffering. To expedite my escape from this agony, I've resorted to extreme measures such as withholding basic necessities to preserve my savings for the inevitable end. Observing a trivial dispute over a few dollars at the store pales in comparison to the weight of my existential despair. The realization that I contribute nothing but consume resources after eighteen years of upbringing is deeply unsettling; I lack the ability to provide for or safeguard anyone, not even myself. Another three months feel like an eternity as I endure my monotonous existence riddled with detachment from life, eagerly anticipating its cessation. In this bleak landscape, death appears as the sole beacon of solace amid the void.\n\nSeeking assistance and outreach for support, I am looking to collaborate on a writing project revolving around the theme of suicide entitled \"Suicide Club.\" If three passionate volunteers with a penchant for writing are willing to join me in crafting this narrative, our goal would be to collectively produce a dark and unsettling novel spanning 12 chapters, each comprising 2,000 words.

I envision a future where I am unable to meet societal expectations, where simply existing without purpose seems like my only escape. My inability to hold down a job for sustained periods leaves me facing the possibility of financial instability and homelessness if my family decides to no longer support me. Even if I were to somehow sustain this way of existence temporarily, the stark reality remains that it is not a viable long-term solution.

This job was my anchor amidst the chaos of my life. I live alone after fleeing an abusive relationship with my ex, leaving me without a supportive partner to lean on during this tough period. My mother is struggling herself after losing her job, and pride stops me from seeking help from my dad about losing mine. I am also considering dropping out of school now. Everything that brought me comfort was stripped away in a brief Zoom call. Finding a similarly lucrative job seems improbable as my previous role was specialized and not easily transferable. It feels like all the progress I made in finally being self-sufficient has been obliterated. Perhaps my ex was right about me - perhaps I truly am worthless and better off gone. The future looks bleak with no guarantee of improvement anytime soon or at all. The cycle of loss and struggle is exhausting; it seems there is no point in continuing this painful charade. At 27, uneducated and alone, the prospect of persisting seems futile. Deep down, I always felt life was a cruel hoax, but fear stopped me from breaking free earlier for the sake of others and myself. Now, that fear has dissipated entirely. Why should I continue enduring for parents who never invested in ensuring my well-being when they had the chance?

While now I find solace in the tranquility of no longer being in pain, solitude envelops me in the confines of a bathroom while my friends bombard me with texts accusing me of \"ignoring\" them.

{"prompt":"- Soon, I'll be tackling another one of the world's issues: myself.\n- It's becoming clearer to me why some individuals resort to committing atrocious acts. Life feels like a cruel joke.\n- Dealing with pills and nausea has always been a challenge during my overdose attempts. Does anyone have suggestions for overcoming this obstacle?\n- I find myself rapidly descending into deep contemplation about suicide. I've shared my struggles before, and honestly, I can now recognize the slippery slope I'm on. After facing significant setbacks, I'm unsure if I have the energy to keep going.\n- To sum it up, my battle with depression and thoughts of suicide has been ongoing for quite some time. The intensity escalated when I began university - lacking friends, coping with social anxiety, and battling depression turned me into somewhat of a recluse. Venturing out only for meals, I started lagging behind academically, ultimately failing in my second year. This marks a crucial point. Turning to drugs thereafter, constantly chasing that initial high through various substances led me down a dangerous path. Experimenting extensively with different combinations of drugs alongside nitrous oxide took a toll on my mental well-being. Subsequent encounters with LSD further exacerbated my struggles. Following these experiences, there were instances where I tried to take my own life, although none were severe enough to warrant hospitalization at the time. This downward spiral continued until the beginning of this academic year.\n       Revisiting academics, due to my drug habits, failing for the second time in my second year was inevitable. Although barely passing the first semester by luck, the online exams during COVID should have been an advantage with open-book conditions; however, this misguided approach led me to cheat and further fueled my delusions. As third year commenced, despite initial aspirations for change, old habits resurfaced swiftly as I experienced one final intense trip resulting in a serious suicide attempt. Returning home briefly to parents' care followed by independent exam attempts ended in failure once more. Shortly after enduring an extensive psychotic episode spanning weeks and another substantial attempt on my life landed me in hospital once again before being discharged a few weeks later despite urging from university officials for me to take time off.\n  Post-hospitalization recovery was marked by additional failed assignment attempts alongside another life-threatening incident that almost necessitated a return to the ward but thankfully didn’t materialize that way after release followed by miraculously passing exams yet failing due partially to previous semester performance deficits coupled with financial challenges regarding tuition costs amidst unsuccessful job searches over summer break leading me back dangerously close towards despair.\n       Mental health deteriorated significantly during this break—with concrete plans considered towards ensuring minimal aftermath following potential departure leaving me on the brink of acquiring necessary items for such an exit strategy.\n       Furthermore, calls suggesting seeking help are already being addressed by professional interventions gone through including exhaustive therapy sessions alongside an extensive array of antidepressants available within the UK market proving ineffective leaving me feeling utterly defeated and directionless indeed aware of repeated concerns raised perused via prior posts thus opting not to reiterate them again.\n- Lately, I've noticed myself sinking back into despair again unsure how much more of this anguish I can withstand considering researched methods awaiting experimentation soon raising questions not about if but rather when such actions might unfold within view foreseeing eternal peace as an appealing prospect.\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}

Over the years, there have been several instances where I tried to take my own life, and surprisingly, I don't look back on those attempts with regret. One particular incident stands out where I was saved by someone who had taken their own life a few years earlier. It's a mix of emotions – jealousy and intense anger towards that person. The concept of \"my body, my choice\" should encompass the right to decide whether or not I want to live. This idea that one is not allowed to die but can just exist in a state of chaos is beyond frustrating; it feels like a flawed system. The most disheartening part is how this mentality seems to spread like a contagious disease. People try to uplift me, but all their efforts seem futile as it only leads them down the path of depression themselves.\n\nYes, I am taking medication, but my condition is major depressive disorder that seems immune to treatment. My moments of happiness have only come when I manage to escape my reality temporarily, just so that the overwhelming intrusive thoughts can't penetrate my mind constantly.

Despite trying medications and therapy, nothing seems to work for me. I feel like a lost cause and a burden on those around me.

Sometimes, I wish for the release of death so everyone could move on and forget about me.\n\nI'm torn about the idea of ending my own life. My childhood was marked by continuous abuse from as far back as I can remember at 3 years old, leading me to struggle with suicidal thoughts since around the age of 10. Multiple stays in mental health facilities and barely managing to graduate due to erratic attendance have been part of my journey. After foregoing college, I found myself working while enduring an abusive parent until eventually moving in with the love of my life.\n\nWhile one might expect things to be better now, they are not. The turmoil in my mind along with a host of paralyzing mental conditions make me fear that I am negatively impacting my partner, despite her reassurances that she comprehends and supports me fully. She tells me not to dwell on my shortcomings, but deep down, I can't shake the feeling that perhaps she is merely trying to console us both through lies.\n\nI cherish her deeply but dread pulling her down with me. She has so much potential in life, while here I am breakdown almost daily with barely enough strength to rise from bed. The future appears bleak for me; therapy since the age of 7 and years on prescription drugs seem futile in alleviating my pain. The idea that by being abrasive and pushing people away they may miss me less if I were no longer around has even crossed my mind.\n\nThe intensity of suicidal thoughts at times becomes unbearable forcing me to contemplate horrifying scenarios just to quell them momentarily- picturing the devastation upon loved ones discovering my fate or the lasting detrimental effects it would have on them and their lives.\n\nThough despising myself and this world immensely, my terror over the aftermath for others keeps me teetering on the edge between holding on and letting go completely.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

There was never a specific trigger for my depression or thoughts of suicide; they have simply lingered for as long as I can remember. Despite trying prescribed medications, therapy, staying active, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, making friends easily, and continuously seeking new experiences to find my purpose in life, the hold of these thoughts on me has been relentless. Although most aspects of my life have gone reasonably well, my struggles with suicidal ideations have repeatedly caused me to derail or contemplate self-harm. This constant presence has become a dominant part of who I am. While it used to frighten me and I yearned to feel better, now I am consumed by apathy and emptiness towards everything. I lack the energy to feign normalcy in social interactions, emotions elude me, previous hobbies feel burdensome, and envisioning any future desires seems impossible.\n\nFor the past couple of years, this sense of detachment linked to my suicidal thoughts has only grown stronger, leaving me unable to find any motivation or reason to continue living. The misery that has enveloped me for as long as I can recall feels inescapable now. Though I know how to behave decently and have formed deep connections in both platonic and romantic relationships, none of it feels worthwhile. I feel utterly exhausted and desperate today; I even acquired rope with the terrifying intention of ending my own life tomorrow.\n\nI am overwhelmed by fear at the thought of enduring the pain that such an action would bring but the longing for release outweighs everything else at this moment. My mind is consumed by thoughts of suicide without any elaborate justifications or external triggers - it just seems like the only viable option.\n\nLife has become a hollow existence for me despite my past successes in social settings; nothing seems fulfilling anymore.

It appears that no one would be significantly impacted by my absence financially which reinforces my belief that now may be an apt moment to end everything. The prospect of experiencing excruciating pain during another failed attempt petrifies me.\n\nDespite experimenting with methods like partial suspension hanging without success due to persistent consciousness and physical discomfort - suggesting improper execution on my part - there is very little else left for me to try other than perhaps opting for a more definitive approach like a full short drop hanging method which terrifies me greatly.\n\nIronically, the prospect of acquiring funds from an upcoming job interview merely serves as motivation for obtaining means such as purchasing a gun instead of providing hope for a brighter future. The job itself offers bleak working conditions at a steel foundry known for its harsh environment and unsatisfactory management; however, it promises adequate pay - a practical necessity given my circumstances.\n\nDepersonalization has led me down this dark path where suicide appears as the only viable solution amidst an overwhelming sense of numbness towards all aspects of life. My dwindling capacity to interact socially stems from perceiving it as more effort than it's worth nowadays while setting goals feels like an invitation for added stress rather than empowerment.\n\nMy battle with depression has been lifelong but the recent onset of depersonalization stripped away any remnants of desire within me leading to drastic decisions like exiting significant relationships and employment situations followed by immobilizing stagnation.\n  \nThe fear of facing agony through another unsuccessful suicide attempt is currently the sole barrier preventing me from taking decisive action despite being financially constrained even in acquiring materials required for alternative methods such as helium or nitrogen administration.\n  \nTrapped in this cycle with no apparent way out leaves me feeling utterly lost.\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}

Recently confiding in my sole confidante resulted in him growing distant, leaving me adrift without our regular conversations - he was my pillar of safety and support.\n\nThese emotions are bottled within me, the fear of being dismissed with phrases like 'it's just a phase' or 'you're young, what possible worries could you have' looms large if I were to open up to someone nearby. As schools prepare to reopen amid the ongoing challenges posed by online learning, I find myself at a breaking point with no outlet for help in sight.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}
{"prompt":"What's the purpose of continuing to exist, really? Is there a substantive justification for persevering that can't simply be brushed aside with the notion that everything becomes irrelevant in death? While the issues that previously triggered my suicidal thoughts have been resolved, I find myself still desiring death because I'm now haunted by the sense of life's futility. For an entire year, I was consumed by thoughts about the insignificance of existence after death and the lack of significance in life. Despite no specific challenges currently urging me towards suicide, I am gripped by this lingering impulse to end it all. But seriously, why shouldn't we just end our lives if nothing carries weight and we won't retain any memories post-death?

People will go to great lengths to prolong someone's misery by obliging them to endure intolerable circumstances. Why? It doesn't always get brighter, does it? I feel like a complete failure. Yesterday was supposed to be the day I bid farewell, but I somehow couldn't muster the energy and kept delaying, and now here we are again today. Why can't I just go through with it? Every single day is filled with regrets for not doing it, so why does my foolish mind resist it so vehemently? Today being Mother's Day makes me want to disappear beneath the surface. Was contemplating making an attempt yesterday due to my wretched, abusive family, and now my friend's actions have only reinforced that they couldn't care less if I were gone – they even blocked me. Perhaps it's time for me to leave now. I'm contemplating using shallow water blackout in my bathtub for drowning myself. Farewell. This is beyond unbearable now; why have there been 8 failed attempts? Why do I fail at everything, even at ending my own suffering? It's utterly unjust; all I desire is release from this agony. Living is becoming unbearable; why does every attempt seem futile? My mother's revolting behavior endangers others and she casts me deeper into despair, yet everyone praises her as though she were a saint while she continues ruining my life; I cannot endure this any longer. Why do none of my suicide missions come to fruition? Is the universe attempting to sentence me to prolonged suffering or compel me to take drastic measures instead? Enough already – let me depart from this malaise; what am I doing wrong that 8 attempts fail consecutively? It appears as though even if I were shot 14 times in the head with a 12-gauge, survival would still be inescapable due to some cosmic intervention prolonging my torment indefinitely. Enough is enough - may I please find peace through death? Life seems utterly devoid of purpose, and my exhaustion is palpable.\n\nFurthermore, there ought to be provisions for euthanasia for those like myself who are exhausted from enduring life’s tormenting cycle incessantly.\n\nOn another note...the recent Reddit update is sheer frustration; navigating through it has become an ordeal due to lag issues exacerbated by each so-called improvement they introduce – it’s baffling.\n\nWhy does oxycodone bring about such unpleasant sensations in me?\n\nI gave oxycodone a try twice about two years ago, and both instances left me feeling profoundly disoriented and unwell when supposedly it should induce euphoria.

{"prompt":"I am overwhelmed by the uncertainty of the future. Merely attempting to motivate myself to study for exams without breaking down into tears is proving to be an immense challenge. My mental health has deteriorated significantly throughout this school year. Apart from sporadic conversations with one person besides my parents, I have secluded myself. There is a multitude of assignments that I have not yet completed, and it's almost miraculous that I am hanging onto a C- in my most challenging classes. Now that I am faced with all the unfinished tasks, it has dawned on me that according to the syllabus I neglected to read, late submissions are no longer accepted since we already completed our final test. As for my AP Biology exam on Thursday, the situation is dire. I haven't been attentive throughout the semester, and my current grade of C- is solely due to relying on Quizlet for every test. The pressure is becoming unbearable. Although logically I know it's just a matter of enduring another two weeks until it's all over, emotionally, it feels like an insurmountable hurdle. The previous AP exam last Thursday was a blur of relentless studying and tear-filled nights. It saddens me deeply that thoughts of suicide are now creeping into my mind when they never did before in this past year and then some. If it weren't for my parents, who have unspoken expectations of greatness from me despite being unaware of the turmoil within my mind, I might not care at all. They recognize my intelligence, which adds to the weight on my shoulders as they remain oblivious to how broken my mental state truly is. Lately, as I am maturing, discussions about the future have been more frequent in my household—decisions about college choices, majors, and career paths loom over me like a dark cloud. But truth be told—I don't have the answers; I'm lost in a sea of confusion. Up until now, I've not delved into such complex considerations; instead, I've focused on staying content day by day since the onset of quarantine. My once-reliable coping mechanisms seem futile now as they crumble beneath me—the support system that held me together is no longer there. It feels utterly desolate how these longtime emotional crutches are failing me when I need them most. Where do I turn now? It feels pathetic pouring out all these bottled-up issues as a 15-year-old here—I feel like my problems pale in comparison to what others endure daily.

{"prompt":"I have been battling with suicidal thoughts for what feels like a lifetime, and today I find myself feeling completely cornered. There was never a specific trigger or event that led to my depression and thoughts of suicide; it seems they have lingered within me for as long as I can remember. Despite undergoing prescribed medication treatments, attending therapy sessions, maintaining a healthy and active lifestyle, easily forming friendships, and consistently putting myself out there to explore new experiences in the hope of discovering a sense of purpose, my struggles with suicidal thoughts have often derailed me. This dark cloud has been a constant presence in my life, almost defining a significant part of who I am. Initially, the thought used to terrify me, and I yearned to break free from its grip. However, over time, I've grown indifferent and emotionally numb towards it all. I lack the energy to pretend to be normal or engage in conversations with others; emotions evade me, my old hobbies now feel burdensome chores, and picturing any sort of future desires eludes me.\n\nThis feeling of detachment or \"depersonalization\" linked with my suicidal tendencies has persisted for years now, and more than ever before, I struggle to find any reason or will to continue living. Despite moments of success in various areas of my life and forming close relationships both platonically and romantically, nothing seems compelling enough to justify the effort it takes to carry on. At this juncture, I feel utterly exhausted emotionally and mentally. The idea of ending it all looms large in my thoughts; the allure of relief is strong despite the dread of potential pain.\n\nI am close to breaking point; today I acquired some rope as part of a plan that frightens me with its envisioned anguish. The desire to end this torment is overpowering me, leaving me at a loss for what steps to take next. While some may offer words of encouragement about how things will improve over time, my reality feels like an escalating spiral of despair rather than any semblance of hope. As financial responsibilities loom overhead without viable means to address them adequately, escaping this existence seems increasingly appealing despite the apprehension towards the physical suffering involved.\n\nThe only thing that propels me through an upcoming job interview is the prospect of obtaining funds for a firearm purchase—a dire solution for an even more desperate situation beckons me towards acceptance rather than resistance. The prospect of numbness induced by depersonalization has rendered suicide as seemingly the sole viable option left on this desolate path.\n\nIn summary: Depression has been a lifelong companion overshadowed now by depersonalization which strips away any sense of motivation or desire within me. Day-to-day activities appear as burdens rather than joys; interactions feel exhausting instead of fulfilling; setting goals seems pointless amidst overwhelming feelings of hopelessness veering towards self-harm as an escape route from this unending mental anguish.\n\nFinancial constraints further confine me like invisible shackles—too financially strained even for alternative methods due to lack of resources which also hinder progress towards securing employment opportunities amidst this suffocating stasis where every effort appears futile in comparison with ending it all—a paradoxical standstill trapping me without reprieve nor direction forward.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" at"}

It doesn't instill in me a desire to break free and revel in life because I've ceased to care, letting things unfold as they may until I'm laid to rest. Frankly, I'm tired of society's fixation on \"having a personality\" and \"being a good person.\" It seems like everyone wants you to dance to their tune. I have no interest in seeing the positive side, projecting confidence, or showing assertiveness. Those qualities elude me. And if by some miracle I possessed them, I wouldn’t yearn for them anyway. That's my stance. Given the freedom as humans to shape ourselves however we choose, I opt for nonexistence. I wish to be the vanishing pixel that fades away unnoticed or the puzzle piece forever lost. The emphasis on appearances exhausts me. People invest so heavily in others' outward facades—it's nauseating. Perhaps I should start treating people with rudeness that mirrors my perception of humanity.

Despite making efforts to mend things with my sister and seeing some improvement, I still feel incredibly distressed. It seems highly likely that the abuse I endured has resulted in some form of PTSD and general anxiety that lingers within me. A series of health complications have arisen, which my therapist attributes to my anxiety issues. The overwhelming sense of isolation and neglect weighs heavily on me. I carry this belief that I may never experience genuine love, feeling like a mere blemish on the world. Tears stream down my face as I admit this deep yearning not to face the world alone. What I desire is companionship, someone to share my days with as we age together, devoid of any romantic implications. Even if that companionship were to be lost, I would cherish having known the trust and reciprocated love that comes with it. Instead, people either walk away upon witnessing my vulnerabilities or exploit them for their gain, compelling me to cut ties with them. Why do I seem so abandoned by all? My solace lies in my faith eventually, but presently all it brings is agony. Even amid moments of stillness like gaming or reading, all I can sense is an ever-present tension and ache throughout my body. It feels as though nobody is willing to lend an ear without a transaction involved. While I am fortunate to have a compassionate therapist who hears me out without passing judgment, it's disheartening to realize that without compensation, loneliness would be my sole companion. She often advises living in the moment, but when I attempt to do so, the sensation mirrors being at the bottom of a decaying pit.\n\nSince enduring physical abuse from my father, I've carried this feeling of being an outcast and fear it may eternally define me as such.

Going out for dinner feels pointless. I feel unattractive in everything I wear. At 40, my appearance is overshadowed by how much better my mom looks compared to me. There seems to be no point in continuing; suicide feels like the only solution.\n\n- I can't stand my boyfriend. He talks incessantly, with each word feeling like a subtle dig at my self-worth, not purposely hurtful but still deeply cutting.

Despite these plans being temporary solutions to what feel like insurmountable permanent issues, the truth is that I find no pleasure in life and have no desire to continue living. It is my earnest wish for people to understand and respect this stance.\n\nI lack any passion or motivation strong enough to sustain me; coupled with my feeling of incompetence in all areas, the idea of pursuing interests or exploring the world holds no appeal for me. Not only do I struggle with personal motivation, but I also find myself devoid of social connections. Having Asperger's syndrome makes me socially inept, rendering me incapable of forming friendships—a predicament that seems destined to persist throughout my lifetime.

No amount of persuasion can alter this resolve.\n\nIf faced with having to endure decades before forming even a single acquaintance, I would rather take the drastic step of leaping off a bridge without delay.

The evident time constraints become apparent after around thirty minutes when it becomes clear that they aim to conclude the conversation swiftly. If suicidal thoughts are expressed, one must tread cautiously to avoid being involuntarily committed; queries about plans and methods regarding self-harm could trigger such actions.\n\nIn light of lacking a clear method for suicide, I seek someone who can empathize and provide an alternative viewpoint via text communication. My mind is consumed by incessant negative self-reflections and thoughts that weigh heavily on me.

Despite discovering unsettling things, like the explicit video left for me to find or her hidden truths about my ex's unsettling behaviors, I don't hold her entirely responsible. The revelation of my ex's disturbing inclinations and behaviors came well before our relationship reached its breaking point. While such betrayals are sadly common in many relationships, this inner turmoil stems from a deeper struggle that predates her involvement in my life. It's draining because I strive to be a decent individual despite battling this inner darkness. However, despite my efforts to combat it, the situation continues to deteriorate. To add to the complexity, my family fails to acknowledge this underlying issue and persist in attributing it solely to my past relationship's failure.

Feeling inadequate in skills and dreading the need for references and constant top performance in job roles only adds to my distress. Despite multiple attempts, I struggle to excel even in interviews. This cycle seems endless, and the pressure to meet job standards and financial demands is overwhelming. The high cost of living and complexities of the housing market in the UK exacerbate my worries. I find myself easily overwhelmed, unable to assert myself when faced with unfair treatment—an all-too-common occurrence in my experience. The thought of preparing for work fills me with dread as I feel trapped in a relentless rat race, with suicide feeling like the only escape route. While I have other issues to contend with, financial stability is currently my main concern. However, self-doubt clouds my mind as I feel intellectually inadequate and struggle to secure references or be proactive due to poor memory retention. A lack of interest in any endeavor impairs my ability to communicate professionally despite efforts to learn from videos and observations. My inability to eloquently respond to questions leads to awkward pauses that are deeply embarrassing. A pervasive sense of emptiness weighs me down as life's challenges seem insurmountable at 22 years old, contributing to a growing fear within me.

While I understand their circumstances, the isolation during weekdays weighs heavily on me. Solitude offers some respite, but my thoughts turn dark when I'm alone amidst a crowd – it's a harsh reality.\n\nNavigating high school as a senior feels daunting, especially when surrounded by individuals who contribute to my distress. Seeking help seems like the logical step, but obstacles stand in my way – school interventions have only worsened matters, and my mom shows little interest in supporting therapy unless she controls the narrative. Financial constraints prevent me from seeking professional help independently.\n\nThe constant ridicule from my mom and her partner for my interests and actions adds another layer of misery to my days. Revealing details about my two friends would likely result in them being driven away by deceitful tactics aimed at tarnishing my image.\n\nWhile I acknowledge my imperfections and past mistakes, the pattern of pushing away those who care about me feels unjust. Despite cherishing my two loyal friends deeply, the thought of burdening them further troubles me; yet options seem limited.\n\nLooking ahead to graduation night brings no solace; in fact, it looms as an endpoint if things don't take a positive turn soon.However if that time comes,I may skip attending altogether because it holds no significance for me anymore.On dark days like these,sometimes it feels easier to just end everything abruptly.\"Things just keep getting worse\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

The online learning setup is something I detest. My parents are already deeply disappointed in me for appearing weak, lacking motivation, and being withdrawn, and this incident might just push them over the edge. I am making every effort to prevent being dropped from the course, but falling behind by a week and having had to drop another class due to stress has me feeling overwhelmed. It's frustrating how passive I've become because of struggles with anhedonia and apathy. I feel disconnected from myself. How can I rediscover who I am? Making decisions or thinking rationally feels impossible; it's as if my thoughts have shut down unless prompted by others. A part of me wishes there was a straightforward diagnosis from a doctor because articulating what's wrong seems beyond me. There is definitely something seriously off, though I can't pinpoint it exactly. The idea of ending everything when I turn 21 crosses my mind involuntarily.

The societal pressure to exude happiness and jubilation weighs heavily on me. Instead of joy, I am consumed by a profound sadness at the prospect of enduring another day where expressing my true emotions is deemed unacceptable. Birthdays, it seems, serve as a mere opportunity for acquaintances and family members to commend themselves for their gestures of remembrance and kindness. It has been four to five years, since around the age of 11, that I have genuinely savored celebrating my birthday. A sense of enduring contentment eludes me. Why do others perceive my life through rose-colored glasses? I tirelessly toil like a man possessed in pursuit of gaining acceptance into an Ivy League institution to liberate myself from the constraints imposed by my parents and this dreary town. Is it too much to ask for someone who comprehends the depths of my being, unafraid to embrace the authentic me rather than the facade I present to the world? Regrettably, those who fit this description exist solely within the confines of my imagination. Fantasies about love and universal acceptance pervade my thoughts; envisioning an idealized family offers solace until reality rudely disrupts these illusions with its stark contrast. The resulting pain cuts deeply. I find myself teetering on the edge where my struggles fail to evoke genuine horror or compassion from others, yet remain potent enough to inflict internal wreckage upon me. This limbo leaves me loathing this existence where others endure far greater hardships while here I am shedding tears like a fragile soul. Why can't I transcend these limitations? What destined me to traverse this desolate middle ground riddled with emotional turmoil? If only I could linger long enough in a realm where illusions reign supreme—a place devoid of insecurities about weight or appearance, where all desires are fulfilled, and where moral inadequacies vanish into obscurity—then perhaps peace would find me in non-existence.

{"prompt":"I have recently been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. It's quite a revelation. While it does help make sense of many things in my life, accepting it was initially tough. Nonetheless, I am back in therapy now, so there's hope for improvement. I do struggle with strong bipolar tendencies, which sometimes mirror those of my abusive uncle. However, I want to emphasize that I would never cause physical harm; my concerns lie more in my ability to manipulate others, a trait that unsettles me at times because I never wish to become that person. Despite feeling persistently lonely and directionless, unsure of my path forward in life, there has been an overall improvement compared to how things used to be. I sense a growing familiarity with myself and a gradually increasing acceptance of who I am, irrespective of whether I actually like the person I see in the mirror. To everyone reading this, please know that even when you feel at rock bottom, there is always room for improvement. It is often essential to reach that lowest point before things can begin to get better; after hitting rock bottom, the only way further down is towards death. For me, hitting rock bottom involved enduring severe depression and bipolar episodes while teetering on the edge of becoming abusive and struggling with daily bouts of vomiting for almost two years. However, these past two years have seen significant progress and healing - it's surreal to reflect on how much has transpired yet how little it may seem at the same time. Sending love and care to all of you; please find ways to nurture positivity within yourselves and prioritize your safety.

The idea of ending my life before reaching 22 may sound foolish, but it's a way for me to avoid facing more failures in the future. It's a way to save myself from becoming that 30-year-old who never learned to drive, or who never had a girlfriend, or who grew up without a father, or never experienced a kiss. I refuse to become the 40-year-old still being bullied or the 21-year-old already losing hair. At least this way, if I go through with it, I won't burden any children with witnessing my failures or struggles. The thought of remaining a virgin at 50 or never owning a home at 60 is unbearable.

Strangely, there's just one person I feel somewhat comfortable confiding in, but for some reason, I can't bring myself to open up to anyone else, not even my own mother. This individual happens to be the mother of a popular girl and a teacher whom I've known for as long as I can remember. Even though there are other teachers who have been part of my life for years, I can't seem to approach them with my struggles either. Engaging with a complete stranger is out of the question as well since I inevitably end up putting on a facade of being fine when in reality, I'm far from it. There was this one time where I tried talking to a teacher about what was going on, and we had an ongoing conversation for about four months until I felt so mortified by burdening her with my issues that I apologized profusely and vowed not to trouble her further. As a result, communication ceased altogether. Other attempts at seeking help from different individuals have followed a similar pattern: feigning recovery prematurely and subsequently cutting off communication once more.

The intrusive thoughts of suicide linger in my mind, although deep down I admit I may lack the courage to act on them. Despite telling myself that seeking help from a doctor is an option, in reality, I know that might not actually happen\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}
{"prompt":"\"I am making plans to end my life tonight, TRIGGER WARNING. I have been striving to improve my situation for the past two years, but unfortunately, things have only been deteriorating. Therefore, I have decided to take some pills secretly and end it all. My parents do not seem to care; in fact, according to my mother, I am the cause of her depression, and my father is not supportive either. Although my sister may be upset initially, she will eventually move on. If there are no signs of improvement by tonight, I will go through with it. I just felt like someone should be aware.\" Original post about attempting suicide last night has been removed.\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}
{"prompt":"How can I convey to others that my life seems beyond repair? It's frustrating when those around me, who have never experienced the same hardships, offer empty reassurances that things will improve. Hearing \"life will get better\" feels like a meaningless cliché. I find solace in the thought of death as a release from this unending pain. I have even made provisions for my funeral expenses to spare anyone else the burden. It almost feels as though ending my own life is inevitable.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}
{"prompt":"Feeling really low lately. This month has been a complete disaster. I opened up to my mom about possibly needing anti-depressants, and all she responded with was 'schedule a doctors appointment' instead of showing any concern or offering to talk. I feel like giving up and sometimes think about ending it all, imagining the insincere mourners at my funeral – just one final disrespectful gesture.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}
{"prompt":"I am considering voluntarily admitting myself to a mental health facility at a hospital, possibly for an indefinite period. Lately, the intensity of my suicidal ideation has become overwhelming. Coupled with escalating anger issues, I feel like a volatile entity, resembling a fierce dog in a cage yet looking like a crude sketch by an inexperienced child due to the numerous self-inflicted cuts covering me. I am in a perpetual state of agitation, primed to lash out at even the slightest inconvenience regardless of circumstances. I genuinely fear that this trajectory could culminate in me causing severe harm to someone and subsequently facing imprisonment. Thus, I am torn between seeking help by presenting myself at an emergency room and disclosing my suicidal intentions for admission to a psychiatric ward or following through with ending my life. These deliberations persist as I have not taken any action yet. However, I am leaning towards the belief that it would be more beneficial for society if I were to remain institutionalized for the remainder of my days. With no familial connections to consider, the notion of being missed or mourned seems improbable. The financial aspect is also a concern, but ultimately uncertain and insignificant in comparison to my current turmoil. The bleak prospect of meeting a destitute end in obscurity is not daunting to me. If that fate awaits me, so be it. Signed as Ava for what may be my final communication. Farewell.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

I resorted to trying with a knife, but that also failed. Now, I am contemplating using a rope. Although I haven't scouted the location, there is a building nearby. However, the idea of causing trauma to others is holding me back. What should be my next course of action? This decision feels inevitable and long overdue.

{"prompt":"Sinking too deep once more. Feeling immobilized, with a throbbing headache today. All I want is to hunker down indoors and battle through. It's a constant battle, isn't it, folks? Friends can be amusing but seem indifferent to my struggles. Pressing pause on the bleeding before heading to work is a chore. The thought of self-harm before work is disheartening. Opting for long sleeves to conceal the scars on my arms. The awareness of my self-harm seems unimportant to them; it's frustrating. I've come to the sudden realization that I don't belong and feel utterly self-absorbed. I yearn for understanding as opposed to being labeled as self-destructive all the time. It's impossible to rescue everyone in this unforgiving world. The inclination for self-harm persists despite not wanting others to engage in it.

{"prompt":"The most straightforward ways to support a struggling friend are frequently the most overlooked. Many people's initial instinct when attempting to aid a friend grappling with suicidal thoughts is to search for a fix to their problems. Advising a friend to seek help from a professional, such as a psychiatrist, and aiding them in doing so can be truly beneficial, there's no denying that. However, before delving too deeply into problem-solving mode, it’s important to remember two simple gestures that can go a long way in offering support – hugs. Yes, genuine hugs. When was the last time you asked a guy when he was last hugged? Most likely, he can't recall. And for girls, who would refuse an offered hug? Secondly, support. Not interrogations or advice, but just simple backing and presence. The overwhelming need to find solutions often causes us to overlook these basic gestures of empathy and care.

{"prompt":"I feel like a huge letdown. I don't possess any discernible talents. I compare myself to others but my narcissistic tendencies hinder me from acknowledging that fact. My attempts at writing profound philosophical texts seem futile; despite holding a philosophy license, my pursuit of a master's degree is proving to be a major challenge. The ideas I generate feel like nonsense emanating from my misguided belief in their brilliance. It's disheartening. My self-worth seems limited to just my appearance. It's as if my only merit lies in my physical attributes. I'm disillusioned with myself, feeling worthless and contemplating drastic actions.

{"prompt":"I feel utterly hopeless, like a lost cause with no way to change my situation. Since returning from university, I've felt perpetually stuck, lacking any valuable skills. My family seems to be losing faith in me - my father barely communicates, and I constantly burden my sister without being able to assist my mother. Despite my efforts to improve things, they have all been unsuccessful. The job applications I have submitted were unsuccessful and did not align with my true interests. My aspirations in life seem unrealistic and unattainable; they only serve to drain resources and time, deepening the resentment towards me as the family disappointment. Even something as simple as booking driving lessons proved disastrous as I unintentionally chose a costly instructor, adding to my sister's stress. It pains me to admit it, but maybe my family is right - perhaps I am destined for failure in everything I pursue.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" in"}
{"prompt":"Why do people continue to desire to bring children into this dismal contemporary era? Don't they realize the state of decay the world is in, heading towards a descent into chaos? It seems blatantly obvious, doesn't it? Why is it that individuals struggling with mental health issues seem to grasp these harsh realities more acutely than those considered \"normal\"? I've been labeled as pessimistic simply because I'm enduring hardships. Yes, grappling with my mental health and suicidal ideations has given me a clearer understanding of the world and potential solutions, and yet I receive backlash for expressing realism and honesty – quite expected, really. If someone battling mental illness or experiencing suicidal thoughts chooses to have children, that's their prerogative, and I won't pass judgment. There's no strict dichotomy of good versus bad; rather, there exist decaying religions and societal norms that lean towards punitive\n\n###\n\n","completion":" id"}

{"prompt":"This will be my final post. I have made the decision to end my life tonight. I am resolved to find a way to stop being a coward finally. This post is a continuation of my previous one for those who have seen it. The school contacted me and mentioned that I could be marked as truant, but fortunately, I intercepted the voicemail and deleted it before anyone else heard. Just to clarify for anyone who may be confused, I am unable to continue with that particular class. My guidance counselor, who seems preoccupied with eating chips instead of attending to her responsibilities, failed to review her email promptly and remove me from the college-level course in time. What's the use of showing up or making an effort when failure seems inevitable? Last term, I received a mere fifty, and the only path to passing now demands an eighty this term. It seems like an insurmountable task, especially with only a week remaining. Moreover, when it comes to school and mental well-being, my parents—mainly my mother—prove to be exceedingly harsh and unsupportive. Taking my own life feels like the sole means of escape. I have already crafted my farewell in a suicide note saved on my notes app. I contemplate deleting everything and resorting to using scissors to cut my wrists when everyone else is asleep. Farewell, everyone. It is somewhat disheartening that I never had the opportunity to pursue anything substantial in life—not that it was within reach anyway.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" be"}

The challenges in my life are predominantly a result of circumstances beyond my control.\n\nFor many, life feels like an unremitting burden while some seem to effortlessly enjoy its pleasures. We find ourselves toiling longer and harder for diminishing returns, all to feed the insatiable greed of the ultra-wealthy. A blue-collar worker in the 1950s-1970s enjoyed a higher quality of life compared to what a young professional experiences today. As a man, it's tough for me to navigate the realms of love; when I assert my standards (which are not superficial based on appearances), I am met with criticism. It seems unfair that women receive admiration and proposals while men are expected to shoulder all the courting efforts under the guise of equality (supposedly). Throughout my life, I have faced bullying, harassment, and consistent mistreatment. My parents fail to accept me for who I am due to our differing beliefs, leaving me without a supportive partner to turn to; furthermore, issues persist in our relationship. Enduring the constraints of South Asian Muslim culture, even amidst Western influence, has been an additional challenge.\n\nI feel utterly devoid of support; any attempt to voice my struggles is met with backlash and victim-blaming. It's disheartening that there are individuals out there who take pleasure in exacerbating my distress during moments of vulnerability.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" in"}
