{"prompt":"What happened to me. So this all happened 7 months ago now. I'm 17 years old by the way. I went to a friends lake house in April and i went on a tire swing that's only around 2 feet off the ground. I fell straight on my back and nothing really different after. That night I felt very sick and tired, but none of my major symptoms yet. 2 days later I'm home again. Feel a little off, and my head is very foggy and fuzzy. About a week passes and I see my normal doctor and she immediately says 'Concussion'. As symptoms stay the same, I then see a neurologist who says It's post concussion syndrome. But the thing is I never had any of the 'Normal' concussion symptoms, only the fogginess. So I'm still feeling bad and stuff so then I go see a chiropractor who doesn't resolve anything. Near the end of summer I golfed a lot to try to relax, but I couldn't. So then things started to get worse, my head wasn't the foggy, it felt like I had hot water inside my head. And it was extremely uncomfortable. So then I started seeing a naturopathic doctor who was in natural medicine. He believes he can fix all of my symptoms. Also I got a MRI, x rays and ct scans of my back, neck, front. So then I started seeing a concussion clinic and I stopped going because nothing was helping. My mom suggested CBD oil so I started to take that and it didn't help. It made things worse, I was extremely inflamed in my head. Later on I start seeing a naturopathic doctor who suggest I see a couple vision doctors and there was no red flags. I also got a neurotransmitter test. He believes that it could all be anxiety, so I started taking Cymbalta. So far nothing has helped went from 30 - 60 - 30 MG. Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore. I've tried so much. On my neurotransmitter test I had a low vitamin D so now I take that and nothing helps. Also I had super high cortasal level. And he said it's almost like I got chased by something for it to be that high. Symptoms Include :. Face gets all tight. Neck gets really stiff. Temples get tight. Hot water and Moving\/zapping feeling all around for head and temples. Laying head on anything, symptoms worsen and head moves around as I lay against anything. Itchy around eyes. Things get worse when I sit down. Itching inside head. Middle of back moving as I lay against anything. My most uncomfortable symptom is my head being super inflamed and hot. And moving.

I Constantly had inner monologues, inner narratives and very broad imagination and creative mind i used to stay at home alot reading my grandfathers books while kids were playing outside and I hated going to school and i hated the educational system and being indoctrinated to the mundane ways of learning was more than boring for me. at school i would act as thewallflower. And id be invisible ironically many students teachers recognize my abilities remembered me but i never did i wasnt included in that environment mentally. And i believe that learning should be solely with self autonomy. Going back to another key point. Long before school happened it all started at home. My family are very conservative they have rejected any idea that doesnt suit their limited scope of things thats why i leaned towards my grandfather who was more open. Home is where i felt very neglected gor instance in comparison to my older sister who was incredibly extroverted and somehow shadowed my presence not ofc her fault snd also the fact that my youngest sister who is seemingly mentally ill ( lack of o2 birth caused her brain damage) her condition is very rare she needed the most care from my parents and as a result i was looked over that i seemed normal therefore i didnt need guidance consequently being outcasted and sent to coventry ( lack of developing functional social skills) and for that i was ostracized from an early age those sinking feelings of loneliness seemed to grow with me. My parents They never pushed me to talk and i was always yelled at by my teachers and my parents to fit in. I didn't speak for almost 15 years. It was a comfortable safe place for me but also a living nightmare. I recall experiencing a car crash with my dad and i was the one who was harmed he never took me to the hospital he took me to school and i was left traumatized and i still have nightmares of being hit until today. They even took my cat and never let me have a cat i want my cat back. I remember a teacher that had long nails and she poked my right eye unintentionally and for that i lost vision in that eye and my parents never intervened nor complained to the administration. Bullying trauma ( physical sand mental abuse) deteriorated my mental and physical health being an easy target outside of a group with little to no support system i received no empathy no interventions i cried myself to sleep then wakeup tl go to through the exact same hell in where i would be harmed mercilessly again my parents neither school helped me in any way possible. Eventually i started to hear negative voices and the constant state of stress led me to be diagnosed with epilepsy and i would be hospitalized when I get the flashbacks and have mental breakdowns. My deceased grandfather was the only person who was keeping alive. The absence of this great figure. His death was also a part of my trauma. And me developing a sense that everything everyone dear to me will leave me ( strong feelings of abandonment and resistance to that matter) i know that death is inevitable but i never seem to accept it i would do anything to spend just a second with him. This paralyzing fear of abandonment lead me to wall myself to avoid being hurt. It's also horrible to feel like you only have a single person who's remotely keeping me going and when theyre gone.youre gone. Rejection of dreams \/lost dreams opportunity to study engineering in malysia and i had a complete scholarship it was for me a new start but my dad rejected it after me finishing all the papers at the last moment( his premise is that girls aren't allowed to live alone \/ wouldnt help me financially ). The crippling depressives reaction caught me off guard suffocated me with my evil thoughts. At that moment I realized that life is a continuation of a series of mental breakdowns Life is miserably unfair Its not even sad its down right infuriating. I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants that were prescribed to me earlier secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self and my body rejects food that days pass with me eating one small meal and cups of water and i managed to disturb the normal process of healing. I didn't succeed to study masters because im an absolute failure I lost every friend i had i wish i was good enough. I failed miserably. I had come to realize my inability to accept my ordeals. I never deserved anything. I always sabotage the gifts. And 'that's lifeas funny as it may seem Some people get their kicks Stomping on a dream''What's the easiest way to end it?. ->","completion":" ideation"}

Nobody really liked me when I was little. I was constantly bullied and even most of my teachers encouraged others to abuse me. My mom hates me and made it clear that she loves her boyfriend more then me, since she always threatens to get rid of me whenever we argue. The people in family who loved me, friends who like talking to me and even a handful of teachers who actually believed me, are gone now. Those friends have disappeared, those people in my family are dead and, there's no chance of getting those teachers ever again. Not to mention, my other relatives and cousins forgot I existed long ago and they didn't even like me. As you can see, most people want me dead. Through all if this, I'm lucky to have found two friends who do care about me, for whatever reason. Though one of them might be dying and the other one is always super busy (I don't blame them for it. It just sucks that we can't do much). However, they're both doing online school and I don't have anyone else to talk to. Neither of them exist during the week so it's just me. I don't mind being alone but, I need to be completely alone to feel be okay. When I'm alone and around people, only bad things happen to me and my thoughts aren't kind. I really can't get that though. Considering I am only a senior in high school and I'm on the younger side so I have a good year or two before I can do anything. I know I need to be away from the people surrounding me but, like I said, I can't do anything. I tried going to the school but they made things worse. My mom doesn't care enough to put me through therapy (well, as long as she can't listen to what I say and what I say. Which is obviously something a therapist can't really do, since it's not allowed in their job). I would do it myself but I don't have money or a job. Things wouldn't be so hard if my mom and her bf didn't make fun of me for everything I like and do. God forbid I make them aware of my two friends, they'll drive them away and lie to make them hate me. I know I'm not perfect and have made mistake but, constantly pushing my friends away isn't fair. I don't think I deserve that. As you can see, I don't have much to live for. I love my two friends dearly and I'd hate to put them through that but, I just don't know what else to do. Living a whole year when you know you need help and that something's wrong with you, is unbelievably hard. I honestly didn't think it would get this bad. I promised myself that if things don't get better. I can kill myself on graduation night. Even if I do live that, I still don't want to attend graduation.

{"prompt":"Friend may kill himself soon. Unsure what to do. I have a good friend that I met online 14 years ago, and we finally met in person last year and really connected on a much deeper level. I have been suicidal on-and-off for much of my life due to having a bad case of Crohn's Disease and because of stress, anxiety, and depression. Fortunately, I am in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months (which is a first for me). I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded. Anyways, my friend has been struggling with chronic depression and severe anxiety for much of his life, as well as neuropathic pain and disc degeneration of his spine. He has been on a large number of different medications and nothing has helped him significantly. He has tried various therapies and seen many psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists. Nothing has substantially helped him. The last couple of years have been particularly hard on him, and he is now really struggling. He is now at the point where he seems to have decided that he is going to commit suicide at some point in the near future (could be days). He is married and has a partner of 18 years. I'm not sure what I should do. I am there for him in any capacity he needs me, to listen, to offer suggestions, and to try to distract him or help him devise strategies to make it through the day, and to provide my perspective over how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide (which is why I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets). If I told his partner - who is somewhat controlling (not in a way that is abusive - he is just very high strung) - it would be a disaster, I think, and I suspect it might make things worse. Do any of you have any suggestions? He was committed once to a psych ward for a night due to having severe issues sleeping (according to him) and he said it was the worst night of his life, so I would never want to put him in that position again, either. He keeps waiting for the universe to hand him a miracle or a sign or purpose, and I don't think the universe works that way: I think you have to go out and make your own purpose, but of course, when you are severely depressed, just getting out of bed can be an overwhelming effort. Any suggestions \/ perspective would be much appreciated. ->","completion":" indicator"}
