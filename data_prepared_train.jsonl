I've posted a few times and tbh I can see the slippery slope that I've fallen down. I've had a few major setbacks and I'm not sure I can be bothered.\\n\\nI'm going to make a long story short. I've struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts for a long time now. The intensity of which increased when I came to uni, no friends, social anxiety amongst lack of motivation and depression led me to basically become a hermit. Emerging from my dorm only for food, I started to really fall behind and in second year I failed. This is important. From here I turned to drugs, progressively chasing my first high from different substances. I experimented a lot, I took anything and everything bar opiates. I tripped out a lot messing with different combos of drugs combined with nitrous oxide \/ balloons. This fucked with my mental state a lot. I then took lsd, not once but three times. This also really fucked with my mental state. A few times after my trips I would attempt suicide but nothing serious enough to land me in hospital. From here I became delusional. This get going up until the beginning of this academic year. When things got really bad. \\n\\nGoing back to academics, my drug habits meant that I was failing second year for the second time. I had managed to scrape a pass in the first semester but exams were where I fell behind. Alas some good news, covid happened so exams were online. Perfect open book too no way I could fail. Except this mentality meant I did zero work and knew nothing when it came to the exams. So I cheated. This added to my delusions. Third year comes, new year new me. Didn't last long fell back into bad habits fast, tripped out that final time and made my first serious attempt. Went home to my parents for a while. Did my exams this time on my own. Fail them. Not long after had a full blown psychotic episode lasting a few weeks, made another really serious attempt. Admitted to hospital for a while. Released a few weeks later, uni seriously urge me to take time out. But conyinue and do assignments I knew I was failing and made another serious attempt which should have landed me into a ward. Get released, and then pass my exams by some miracle. But failed the year due to first semester exams and second semester assignments. Had a plan for summer, in other words get a job and get more financially stable. Didn't work. Also wanted part time work for when I return to uni happening soon. But no-one wants me. Applied for student finance. Not allowed it, the only give support for one fuck up year. So here I am with literally no money to my name, have serious issues when it comes to paying for university fees and not able to land a fucking job. \\n\\nMental health seriously declined over this summer break. I have methods that are pretty much guaranteed. And please don't message asking what they are, I'm not telling you. Begun taking steps to make sure there's no cleanup needed by my parents when I'm gone. Close to buying the necessary items for that swift exit.\\n\\nOh and also don't tell me to seek help, I'm already under professional care had all the therapy available and tried almost all antidepressants available in the uk.

I was compared to my neighbor's daughter a lot when I was younger. I guess my parents just thought it was an effective method of encouraging me to do better. While I did try to satisfy what they wanted in me, it never felt enough because they would keep doing it over and over again. It's like I had to always outperform the neighbor's kid or else they would just constantly compare me and berate me. It didn't help that she used to bully me and threaten me because her parents were our landlords and had more money than us.\\n\\nShe did become a better person later on and is much kinder now. But I always still felt like I had to compete against her because I hated how condescending her parents were towards me. They used to call me stupid and retarded and they made sure to hint that what they were saying about me was true because my brother turned out to be severely autistic, which they thought meant that both of us were lesser humans. Fuck them because I got into a top college while their kid didn't. I feel really bad for her, though because I know she grew up with a lot of pressure from her parents too. I would hear shouting from her parents all the time and she received harsh punishments for not meeting their expectations.\\n\\nI thought I would now be immune to anymore comparisons from my parents and her parents. Unfortunately not. I still have yet to pass my driving test and I've failed 3 times now. I was berated by my father and he told me he would give up on me and that I was stupid and worthless. It's like my admission to a top college no longer meant anything to him. Today I found out the neighbor's daughter passed her test on her first try and she even began driving lessons later than I did. Now all those negative thoughts are coming back. I havent felt such a hard blow to my self-esteem in a really long time. All of those memories are coming back and are living in my mind rent-free.\\n\\nI have a quiz, exam, and essay all due next week and I am just feeling so overwhelmed. I want to prove them wrong but with everything that's happening right now, I just feel so hopeless. I feel so stupid for letting their comparison get to me again. I hate being so weak-minded. I truly don't believe I deserve to get into the college I am currently enrolled in. Everyone here is so much more charismatic and intelligent than I am. I dont know what they saw in me and I feel foolish for believing I had a chance at succeeding in this school and in this life.\\n\\nI've been thinking about killing myself for a while and I even attempted to hang myself with my jump rope, but it was too weak and I chickened out. It feels so much more different thinking about suicide now because I know if I do end up succeeding, everyone will remember me as the pathetic girl who killed herself over her failed driving test. I used to think that those opinions won't matter once I'm dead, but the thought of that being my legacy just leaves such a bad taste in my mouth. I just feel at a crossroads right now and I dont know what to do. It feels so stupid to be suicidal over something as trivial as failing a driving test when other people around the world are going through much worse. I dont deserve to feel this way and I have no right to.

Im too anxious to have a normal conversation with strangers face to face and even online.\\n\\n Ive done everything I could to get my parents' approval. Grades, awards, competitions, honors, distinctions, college. But I'll never be enough. I dont even think my parents support my intended career choice of being a genetic researcher.

I was sexually assaulted and my family, not listening to me, forcing themselves on me makes me feel the feelings of being sexually vulnerable and sexually, triggered. And I hate it so much,. So fucking much. And I want nothing more than to be fr. But I feel like I'll be here for a long timer. I gotta return to their house through Jan 19th. And I want to be saved. I've been trying to save myself. But I know no one can save me. I feel so trapped, surrounded by these feelings and the people who put me through it. Feel like I have no choice but to lock myself in a house with a mom who's become religiously insane, coddling my Autistic sister. The helplessness I feel in the situation brings up the lust feelings. I jsut want to die. Then there's the whole layer of more \"normal\" trauma. My family treated me like shit. My mom made me buy a car while I was working a shitty min wage job, and after I got in a few accidents, car insurance. Because even though I was trying to work to pay for my dental treatment. My sister, who was coddled, never went to college, had a shit 3 hour a day McDonalds job. And her feeling minimally useful and getting money to spend on Ebay mattered more. So I have to fuck my life and mental health in this job over for her sake. My feelings are never listened to. The minute I get the least bit burdensome my mom expresses she is hurt HURT how dare her daughter betrays her!. I SURVIVED MENINGITIS , LOST MY RIGHT EAR WHILE I WAS AWAKE. WHAT DOES MY MOM SAY WHEN I EXPRESS TRAUMA. \"Relax, you thrived\". \"Don't blame your father\" It was totally all his fault. \"Imagine being the mom of that child! \", said to my nephew KLIKE SHUT THE FUCK UP THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU!. She brushed me aside wwhen my older sister's boyfriend was being an abusive shit to me and my nephew and helped my older sister enable him. There's just, sooo much. And at school, I'm just surrounded by radical left SJW culture (I'm moderate left) , and just their habit of blaming things on big groups of other people (\"You're white, this is your fault, you should feel guilty, go educate yourself!\") They don't get how toxic that is, and I'm just, older than a lot of them so my perspective makes no sense to these kids who are in this bubble. I never got to live that normal life and my family made it ten times worse. My mom lost her job, maybe if my dad hadn't fucking retired so early, completeely, I could have still gone to college then (By the time my mom found a new job, she just asked me to drop out of the college I was set to go to, she didn't feel ready to support me).

{"prompt":"A short long story. Hello all,. I have been struggling with depression for a really long time like since 2nd grade and jts only increased since then. I am currently 19 and my life is going absolutely shitty. My mom and dad both passed away (Mom going on 4 and dad going on 5), I was mentally and physically abused by my mother (yet have no hatred for her) I know she was my mother and the things she did was not ok, but she herself was struggling with multitude of mental illnesses. And my dad was cut out of my life since I was about 11-12, my mom died due to sleep apnea and an enlarged heart, while my father died from a car accident. They were both separated andI miss them very much. anyway continuing on. The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope, and felt hopeless. After attempting, I \"vowed\" that I would just join the military and die in combat, but after moving in with my aunt and uncle that soon changed. Everything seemed to be going well, I was doing well in school and even though I still hated myself it seemed to be going very well. I had friends and family tell me that I was the strongest person they knew and that they always had my back no matter what. But I realized that everything I earned was just mooching off the support and love of everyone else. I only passed highschool and got into college because of them pushing hard, but as soon as college hit it went downhill faster than you can say Oui. My grades went to shit, and my mooching was over. My work ethic lost its way and currently may lose my job. I have multiple attempts on my life but every time I always think of the pain it would put my family through. It gets harder everyday and recently I was arrested with possession of shrooms (which is a felony where I'm from) and spent 2 nights in jail, now the only way to keep it from getting worse is to get my grades up which is impossible bc of all the class and homework I have missed. I don't really talk about my feelings, and I lie every time someone asks me if I'm ok or how I'm feeling. Its mentally exhausting and its getting to the point where my death seems to ultimate answer to bring my family closer, where all I caused was problems and drove everyone away. After moving on campus my aunt and uncle's family is getting better now that I am gone. I also recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident but I can't really find anything besides the hotlines. I'd rather not vent to a stranger on a phone since I get phone anxiety, and rather dump this online.

Because of COVID I had to collect and take care of their new kittens for a couple of weeks before I came home to visit them (support bubble). As a result of nearly 3 weeks of taking care of them alone, they're quite attached to me.

{"prompt":"Death is a mercy I do not deserve. I've been having suicidal thoughts for years now though had only recently been diagnosed psychologically; didn't wanna burden my parents with the astronomical psychologist\/psychiatrist fees in my country. I must also confess that I am a compulsory truant when it comes to appointments with my psychologist and school counselors for pretty much the same reason. They can't charge me if I don't book appointments in the first place). I wanna kill myself. This thought has been a constant companion for years now that at this point it's almost a hobby. In my spare time, I've contemplated and devised almost every possible way to accomplish that in my home quarantine situation. I've calculated how much isopropyl alcohol I would need to ingest in one go in order to guarantee a slow painful death by poisoning. I've tested the strength of every possible attachment point for a noose to see if it can support my fat ass. I've determined whenever the person with the noisy ass sports car is most likely to get out of the house (to work or something idk their life) so that I can potentially jump in front of their speeding car (ruled this option out cuz I don't wanna traumatize them). I even figured out how to ensure that my family members don't catch me in the middle of offing myself before death embraces me. I guess my quarantine hobby has been ideating lol. I can't remember how it started but nowadays, I want to die because I hate myself. Plain and simple. I can't seem to love myself in any capacity. I want to. I really do. I don't wanna be a hypocrite. I see so much beauty and wonder in others, who by their very nature of being human, are automatically wonderful and fascinating to me. But I cannot spare any of that for myself. Idiot. Disappointment. Coward. Sloth. Burden. Failure. Damaged goods. Hypocrite. Emotionally constipated. Man-child. Degenerate. A bad investment. These are the things I tell myself when I'm at my most vulnerable, which rn seems to be a continuous norm. People say this will past. Hell no. I've done everything. I've talked to friends and family and they've yet to convince me that these thoughts are irrational as much as they've tried. If any, I feel worse because of how much I make them worry when they shouldn't. I'm not worth their time. I've sought professional help but the costs are just way too much for continuous visits. Medications aren't working as much as they used to and stronger ones are expensive here. I've tried many hobbies and pursued what was once my passion. Every method has since fallen through especially this year. Early this year, my mom died and I haven't been able to feel anything other than anxiety and self-hatred. To make her proud was pretty much the only thing motivating me and now she's gone. I also feel guilty for her death (I can't expound to conceal my identity. I don't want anyone who knows me who's lurking around here on reddit to get worried). Before, the aforementioned support methods may have worked. But nothing works anymore nowadays. Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself. But I don't do it. I don't deserve to. Death is too damn easy for someone like me. Too lenient of a punishment for someone who's hurt others so much. I don't deserve the release of death. I respect the conviction of those who die because they simply choose to do, out of a desire to cease living. But for me, because of how much I've hurt others, I cannot afford myself that luxury to choose. I must remain and suffer. It is only just. I don't know if this is a good reason to not off myself. But it's been keeping me going for now. I honestly don't know what I hoped to accomplish in this post. I was just scrolling through reddit while ideating as usual and thought to visit this sub. I resonated with what I read. I marveled at the complexity and diversity of suicidal thoughts. I guess I wanted to contribute to the conversation is all. I'm not really expecting advice. I've grown doubtful of others' advice to my struggles. Not for a lack of understanding on their part but for my inability to accurately articulate my situation. ->","completion":" behavior"}

There might be some benefit in getting my parents involved but the fuck I am going to do after, go see a therapist? I hate talking about myself and we'd probably have to do meetings online and if I have to look at one more person through a screen I'm gonna scream. Besides I feel like I'd just waste their time.

{"prompt":"I'm so tired of everything. Things have been so tough. The only thing I find comfort in these days is ideations of suicide. I've been severely depressed lately and have always struggled with depression throughout my life. Everyday I feel like a shitty person for my past decisions\/mistakes. I've ruined practically all of my relationships of potential relationships by being so emotionally unstable and anxious. Looking back at my past behavior makes me feel so much shame with myself. I lost so many friends over the past year. Now that I've graduated college it's much harder to stay connected with people. Doesn't help that I'm unemployed and just at home until I figure out what my next move is. I've isolated myself even further due to the shame and depression I feel on a daily basis due to reasons I mentioned above. I feel so alone and like everyday I'm battling to stay alive. My family is concerned, especially my mom. All I do is confine myself to my room. I hardly have an appetite these days, my sleep schedule has been fucked and I haven't gone to the gym in two weeks. Leaving bed is a challenge. I'm a Black trans man and I have a therapist who is really great and also a person of color, but I often wonder if I'm even able to be helped. Though I confide in her about my issues, I don't tell her about my ideations because 1. I'm embarrassed to admit this and 2. I'm afraid that since she's a therapist she'd have to report it. Having police come to my house would only make everything worse for me. Most days I wish I wasn't alive. Life is too painful and nothing seems to be worth it.

{"prompt":"Work is killing me but I can't quit. Suicide becoming more enticing. Tl;Dr: Working retail has destroyed my body but can't stop working or family will lift a fuss. Nothing is happening in my life, and when I get home all I want to do is rest. All for little pay that my mother then takes half of. I don't know if or when I will take my own life, but if I do, I want to submit my thoughts here. Recently, I've been thinking about whether it would be best to end myself, as it is no different from what I am doing now. While I hate playing victim, I do believe my life was set up in a way that would lead to failure. Or at least make it more difficult to achieve success. I also argue my family plays a part in this. Raised by a single mother, living in a house of single women, has stunted me. Now I work a job I do not like, with mode of transportation that is destroying my body. The work itself also destroys my body, and then I have to use that transport to get home. My body is not getting enough time to even recover. The pay isn't worth it, and then I get part of my paycheck sapped for bills. It's difficult to save up and I constantly need to buy healthy food because my family's diet isn't the best. By next paycheck, my bank account is peanuts in a pocket. It's pathetic. And make no mistake, I take responsibility in this as well. It just feels I have to take the responsibility of their would be husbands\/boyfriends, instead of being built to go out and start a family of my own. They aren't even expecting me to leave! I'm 27 turning 28 in December!. I just feel stagnant. My body is destroyed constantly. So I haven't been able to workout as hard as I used to. Of I try to leave, my mother will think I'm just quitting and not finding other work. Don't know where she got that notion. But I'm sick of it.

{"prompt":"The simplest ways to help a friend who is struggling are often the most forgotten. A lot of people's first intuition when trying to help a friend who is struggling and thinking about suicide is to find a solution to the problem, to fix it. Telling a friend to see a specialist, a psychiatrist, and helping him do so is actually helpful, there is no denying any of this, but before over analyzing the situation remember that there are two things that can go a very, very long way, and help a lot more than you may think:. \\- hugs. Yes, actual hugs. Ask a guy when's the last time he's been hugged. I bet he can't remember. And girls, who says no to giving a hug to a girl. \\- support. Not questions, not advice, but support.

I don't know how to deal with this problem as I do not have the money for plastic surgery. I've basically been abused my entire life (from abusive family to being bullied in school) and I'm very sick of it. I was socially inept for the longest time ever because people would just ignore me.

{"prompt":"Friend told me she thinks I'm going to die. I really need some advice on how to handle this, as I have no idea what to do. A couple of weeks ago my friend told me that she's positive I'm going to kill myself, and that she'd put a bet on it happening if she could. I didn't know how to respond to this, and told her that. I ended up trying to make a joke of it, then told her I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness, and changed the subject. Since then, it's really played on my mind, and it's not sitting well with me at all. Her words have really hurt me, it feels as though she has no faith in me. If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide, she could have just said \"I'm scared you're going to commit suicide\" and I could have tried to reassure her. But what she said was brutal. If I'd been diagnosed with cancer, rather than BPD and CPTSD, would she have ever dared tell me she thinks I'm going to die and would bet on it happening? I doubt it. So why does she get to say that? It's so thoughtless and hurtful. It's made me view her differently and I can barely speak to her. She wants to hang out (she's in my covid bubble) and I don't know what to say, because I'll have to tell her how I feel about it and I don't want to have an argument.

I have a history of childhood trauma and adult sexual assault and domestic abuse. I have been diagnosed with CPTSD and depression and anxiety several times. I am trying. I am trying to heal and am doing all the things I am supposed to in terms of getting help. Another context is that I am an immigrant and my home country is unsafe for me- I am trying to appeal to remain where it is physically safe but I dont know if it will work. I hear back next month. I constantly have flashbacks, panic attacks that last hours, nightmares, and am struggling with eating and sleeping. It has been this way for a very long time. I have kept a log and I mean LITERALLY I have had less than 4 hours of relief during waking hours for the last 6 months CONSISTENTLY.\\n\\nI am unsafe- But I also think something in me is so damaged and broken that I am starting to hurt others. After leaving my abusive ex, I just cannot stop stalking them. I know I am harassing them but I dont know how to stop. This is not okay. I feel like I am behaving in ways that my abusers have towards me in some ways and I cannot stop. My brain just cannot stop fixating on them and I am trying so so so hard every day to keep myself busy and not bother them but I fail each time. I cannot describe the lengths I have gone but I will say that I am definitely causing suffering to this person.\\n\\nNext steps- I am planning to kill myself by the end of February if I cannot remain in a safe country and see improvement in my mental health. Partly because being physically unsafe is something I cannot tolerate again. And I will be unable to receive any treatment for whatever is damaged in me. I just want to say that I am sorry and I dont know how to fix myself. I am a mess. I am constantly in pain and now I am causing people I love pain and I regardless of how much I try, I can't stop. So I have decided to end things not just for own self but especially for others. I am not a safe person for others and I feel unsafe inside my skin. I have too many demons.

Just gotta finish tomorrow and Monday morning getting up early to eat some breakfast. Parents going to work flight leaves at 1:00. Monday. I leave Monday just need to write my goodbyes and I'm also making a video for my brother and my parents. Today I talked to my daughter the oldest cause my little one was at daycare. I'm done my ticket and hotel booked rental car I have my check tomorrow and my bonus from last week so it's enough to get some things before I go through with it. Seems like the universe is really wanting to fuck me. Two days ago I was searching some porn cause I've become addicted to it because I believe due to my ocd. And out of the millions of videos I found one of a girl that looked a lot like my ex. And after watching it for the last two days it was very clear it's her. I don't know if was fate or whatever but I searched the original video cause it's on like three websites. And the time it was uploaded was three years when we were still in but I was doing school and working every night tool after midnight. And I mean I was with her for almost ten fucking years married 7 the day she left me. And this time was also when I had to get admitted to a mental hospital for my first suicide attempt. Was gone for almost two weeks. To make matters worst I opened my eyes realized a lot signs I ignored when I suspected she was cheating on me not just with that fucker on the video but with our roommate as well. I never like the way he was with her always getting presents and always saying all this nice things about her when apparently she hated him. Now it's all clear to me. I sent her the video and told her I don't want an explanation but because of the respect I still gave for as she is the mother of my children I wanted her to be aware this it out the and thousands of people have seen it. Though by the looks of it the dude she's blowing clearly wasn't hiding his phone recording her she was very well aware. So who the fuck knows. I haven't slept in days then this happened just made matters worst. I also sent my manager a message this morning letting her know I'm resigning.

The store employee finally told him he's standing way too close to me, and he still refused to back up. There was plenty of space for him. People do shit like this to me because I'm scrawny and get the impression that I won't stand up for myself. This isn't the first time something like this has happened, but it will likely be the last time cause I'm either gonna overdose or slit my wrists lol. Do you understand how fucking degraded I feel?. I'm most likely going to fail the semester again. I'm most likely gonna fail the semester again. \\n\\nI have so many missing assignments. For example, I have 2 labs and 2 discussions due in 1 minute, only did them about halfway and submitted. \\n\\nBut just because I'm going to fail doesn't mean I'm going to give up and ghost my classes like I usually do, I'm still going to keep trying and submitting what I can till the very end of the semester.' ->","completion":" behavior"}

How do I tell my parents I need help?. I was diagnosed with moderate depression and anxiety so I stopped drinking but somehow my depression has only gotten worse I can't even get out of bed and I have the desire to die. I have no friends left so my only hope is to get therapy and go on meds but I have to tell my parents I need therapy because I can't afford it idk how to tell them it's really hard to talk about especially since I'm not really open with them. I can't stop sabotaging my own life.

My issue is I oversexualize women. Not just in real life but like when I'm watching tv I just look at their bodies. I know it's wrong and I know it's creepy but it makes me scared of girls and I have a hard time controlling it. Here's to another Valentine's Day alone.

Being a Man it is hard for me to find love and I am attacked for dating to have standards (just want a fair deal (and no I am not talking about looks); I am not asking for some blonde hair princess). Women can valuation and offers while a Man has to do all the work (yay equality amirite \/s). I've been bullied, harassed, treated like shit my whole life. My parents won't accept me for who I am because I do not believe the harsh faith I was raised and have no way out cause I don't have a loving partner to go to. And I have other issues with them.

I can't look my girlfriend in the eyes let alone find the courage to ask for help. I realized I haven't looked in the mirror in years because I can't stand the person looking back at me. Dont get me wrong I've looked at my clothes or my new haircut but I can't look beyond the surface.

I haven't even gotten out of bed. My girlfriend thinks I hate her because I can't find the words to tell her I want to die. My son who i lost custody of last year must wonder why his dad isn't there for him anymore but I don't think I can bring anything positive to raising him. My work must wonder whats happened to me, I just dissapeared without explanation but I'm guessing they've now given up on me like I gave on myself years ago.

I feel so calm.\\n\\nThe plan is to slice my veins and throat. I do not mind the pain, I'll just have a panic attack, but my panic attacks mean nothing to me. I'm so used to them. I'm used to the pain that I'll patiently wait for myself to bleed out.\\n\\nAt first I wanted to jump in front of a train, but the traffic is really low. I'd have to wait for summer and quarantine ending. I have no time.\\n\\nWhy am I killing myself? Because I'm just so hurt. I hate my reaction to things happening. I hate the way I think. I hate how much pain it brings me.\\n\\nI get panic attacks everytime you hang out with someone else. Or when I assume things. Or when I believe you don't love me. I honestly don't know anymore. I really wish I did.\\n\\nYou spending time with others even though you do spend time with me, my parents constantly fighting, work falling down on me, my own anxiety and thoughts make me have a terrible terrible panic attack.\\n\\nI hate it. I hate that I can't let you live normally, I hate that I can't be normal and good for you. Aaaand it's getting worse. Can you imagine the future? God, how badly I don't want to see it.\\n\\nI keep having dreams of you. Us spending time together, us talking about things, you holding me, getting ice cream, me complaining and you just agreeing. They make me happy. The memories we made together make me really happy too. When I was fine and interesting. I will forever treasure them in my heart and my head(even though it's made for thinking).\\n\\nBut all things end. That's okay.\\n\\nI wish for you to find someone else. Someone way better than me. Someone out of your league(impossible). Maybe out of my league? Someone that will support you and will know what to do. Someone that won't drown you in negativity and sadness.\\n\\nHonestly, I never believed it. Even as a young teenager I already had my own idea of a perfect soulmate. Personality, looks, etc. You fit right in. You're my wish come true. You're both someone I want and someone I want to become. Though you made me like myself the way I am too. Thank you. And my answer to the thought that follows you: I love you not because of your personality, looks or the way you act. I love them, but that's not the reason why. I love you because you make me happy. But only you do.\\n\\nMy love never decreased when you started to open up. When you look at an army veteran with one leg - do you focus on the leg or the fact that they're a veteran that saved lives? I focus on the veteran part.\\n\\nI don't know what you feel about me though. Are you tired of me? Do you want me to change? I don't know.\\n\\nI wish someone told me whether things are true or just my depression talking. I wish someone told me whether I'm doing things right or not. Am I making you happier? Should I act like this or like this?\\n\\nI remember every time I hurt you. I'm very sorry. I regret saying those things and I'm aware that they hurt you a lot. I never did them again.\\n\\nI can't stop making things worse, so it's better for me to go. And the pain. The constant pain. Just please tell me what I'm doing wrong. Tell me what everyone wants me to do. What makes you happy? What can I do? Someone please analyze everything I do and tell me what can I do to change things.\\n\\nWhen I think about it, the reason why I'm dying is so stupid. It's just not enough, but I'm constantly suffering and want to die.\\n\\nI don't care that it's selfish. Everyone always told me I'm selfish, so it'll be another selfish thing I'll do.

{"prompt":"Bully payback help. My best friend is getting harassed and bullied SEVERELY by a woman she doesn't even know. Not only is she harassing my friend, but she has told her things that have said 'do the world a favor and go kill yourself' as well as 'when I find you it's gonna be the fucking end of you' as well as calling her fat in every way possible. On top of this is creating photoshopped images of my friend having fake conversations towards the bully and others to, I'm guessing, make her look bad. All my best friend has done is ask for her to leave her alone and this woman won't stop. Its going on 5 days now. The woman has created 17 Instagram accounts to harass her over, as well as so far 7 phone numbers, as well as 2 Facebook accounts. It's mentally disturbing my friend at this point. She's been constantly tired. I'm trying to get her to eat and go out and do stuff but she won't and isn't doing well. I think she's really overwhelmed and it's getting to her that she has been advised the police not to respond at all; aka in her mind, not being able to standing up for herself.

He says to me that he probably would have dropped out if he didn't meet those people. How am I supposed to respond to that? Wow congratulations on being lucky enough for that to happen while I'm over here commuting and not talking to a single person every day. He doesn't even have to try to socialise. Girls always start talking to him first. It's demoralising hanging around with him. College is a goner for me at this point. I've fucked up majorly for the second time.

I wish I had friends that would do fun things with me, I wish I had a girlfriend, and most of all I wish I had the willpower to overcome my laziness so I can get out there and follow my dreams. I sit in my room for days on end daydreaming, daydreaming about things that I could be doing in literally five seconds. I daydream about painting, reading, writing; I have paints, canvases, paper and books. Why can't I do anything? I sit in front of the computer screen with my homework up, writing an essay in my head that will never reach the page. For literally a year I've daydreamed about getting my temps; the Bmv is at the corner of my block. I think about running when actually running is a door and a hallway away. I have friends in my mind. There is this girl I saw a while ago in passing and she was absolutely beautiful. I've created a personality for her. In my mind we have a deep, complex, ideal relationship. I don't even know her name so I gave her one. I think I'm making progress in my life, I do more things with each passing day, but the improvement is moving at a snails pace, I can't afford to continue to have my life drowned out by passivity and mediocrity. As I write this I realize that I don't want to die I want to live, and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody. This is probably where I should end it, but I want to write about a few more things I'd like to do. I love politics. I'm very politically conscious and I want to be an activist, I have ideas of how I could change the world for the better but I didn't even attend a George Floyd protest. I don't have the temperament to be a leader, hell, I don't have the temperament to function in life; everything is overwhelming. I've failed three classes in high school. I don't think I'm that stupid, I scored well on the psat and all standardized tests I've taken throughout my life. Now I know that these don't measure intelligence very accurately but I've consistently scored in the 90th percentile or higher and I can't tell if it's the excellent school that I attend or if I'm actually not dumb.

{"prompt":"Considering going to the hospital for suicidal ideation but have no insurance until the 1st of February. So I've hit one hell of a depressive spell. I have bipolar 1 and have been dealing with it's symptoms for at least 7 years now. Due to the virus and having two jobs, all of my usual coping methods have been tossed out the window. I'd usually do some painting, focus on small simple daily goals, and make sure that I'm in public most of the day just to have some kind of minor human interaction. None of which are things I can do right now. So I'm kind of spiraling worse. I'd rather, you know, go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point and while I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change. I've tried reaching out to friends and family, but there hasn't been much in the way of help. My sister said that I was just whining after a while of venting to her and said I needed to think of some practical solutions that I could do now and stop talking about things I can't change. And my parents told me to focus on the positive. The only reason I haven't gone to the hospital or looked for some kind of medical care is that my insurance doesn't kick in until the 1st of the month AND I started a new job as a part time teacher. I've been working there two weeks and if I peace out with no explanation that's gonna make everything worse for the staff. And if they let me keep working there it's gonna be a fucking nightmare to pick up the class after that. Soooooo the hell do I do? I guess I could just wait for the 1st, but that's gonna be a long wait in depression time scales. I don't wanna go broke and I don't wanna come home and have everything falling apart.

Over the last 2 years ive looked for excuses to get rid of the close ones in my life, right you did that your gone. Im 35yo male and i know my family and friends would be deverstated just seems no one cares right now. Im not included in anything and when i am, i feel i bring the mood down to a despresive state. I just feel so disconected like im not there im somewhere else dark and cant see. Ive used hotlines and chats online, they do help but short term, i will be alright for that night or a few weeks. They tell me to go to gp which i have and then been refered to the mental health team(im in the uk) but i find them like consending and of no help 'aww thats no good' sounding symphetic 'do you have any hobbies' in a uplifting voice. It just feels so forced so i stopped answering her calls. I know many people will blame themselves when i do do it and cause so much pain for years to come but at the same time i dont want the existance ive got. I feel like im just rotting away in my flat on my own. I honestly think it would take 2 months before anyone would notice me gone. No one regulary checks on me, i contact them. I spoke to a pyhcolgist few years back not in a proffesional setting someone i knew personally at the time about intrusive thoughts, i asked him when should i be worried and he said whenever i put a plan into an action. Although ive not gone and got a rope it scares me how much ive pushed eveyone who mattered away making it easier to do something, ive also decided i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while, ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police. Im not stupid im told im bright and quite articular. I know this feeling now is temporary and a mindset, i know some recent events have made me feel this way, i know i wont feel like this in few days\/weeks but i also know this will come back around again and i dont want that i want a long term fix. I feel im on the edge im just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge. My own diagnosis:. I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face and terorise and taunt my siblings and parents. I bullied other kids too. I did see a few phycolgists as a child but i think my whit cheek and cleverness convinced them otherwise. The conclusion was always hes perfectly normal to my parents horror. I think i suffer some sort of phycosis, schizofrenia and i think im bi polar. Does anyone know if this is true; that bi polar can be detected by in balances of hormones in the blood, and schizofrenia can be detected by a test, if so does anyone know how i can force my doctor to do these tests? As i have mentioned all 3 of these never had a diagnosis and ive never been given any meds for them or my dark depresive state. I also dont think im getting everythink across of how i really feel and go through when speaking to the doctor or mental health team. The help im looking for:. I know that any profesional couldnt give a diagnosis just online or from what i have written and would tell me to seek a profesional but an indication would really help, i think you could be suffering from. Or i think these medications could help you (please only offer meds advice if your from the uk). Also i know i need to change my mindset, does anyone know of any books i could read to change my mindset or find a better way of coping or understanding things. Thanks for reading and any support given. Anyone feeling the same way just talk it does help even if its that stranger on a chat hotline. Everyone else be kind in the world, dont judge anyone even that drug user or thief you never know how they are really feeling or what they have been through to get in that state they're in.

{"prompt":"All i want is to be normal. I wish I'd been born neurotypical. Had ADHD all my life. They used to say it goes away at puberty, but they were wrong. It gets worse. Much worse. It changes you into the kind of idle, infinitely distracted lazy looney you see so much on tv. Nothing can be bothered with anymore unless it's interesting, and almost nothing is interesting unless you're so hyperfixated on it that you can repeat the wikipedia page word by word. I lost my ability to socially relate, be a normal human being, when it happened. Everything they said about me at the time was 100% right. I really did try and look up girls' skirts. They did it in anime, and that was my obsession at the time. I was, and remain, an unstable freak. I was a creep, because that's how I acted. I reread the same books over and over like a madman. No wonder I was bullied so relentlessly. Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die, and it's never been far away from my mind since. I'm thoroughly scared of people. Not in meeting them, but in losing them. My best friend said it best: \"I deal with him.\" I alienate everyone. I say weird shit with no context that makes sense only to me. I offend people because I speak without thinking. Mom told me once that when she and dad got a divorce it'd be all my fault, and it was. It's always my fault. The worst part is that I was supposed to have every advantage. White, male, private school, rich parents and a full ride through college. No debt. I blew it. All of it. Got two shitty, worthless degrees, that could bring me zero prospects in life. Was given a job at mommy's office to stay out of trouble, and I was fired for being suicidal at the end of my 90 day trial period. Above all else, I'm lonely. I'm a creep. I long for something, someone, I could never receive on my own merits. Women, more than anything else on earth, terrify me, because I know I'm a short ugly bastard with no prospects and no social skills. I don't deserve anything, much less someone. Every relationship I've ever had has fallen apart within a month. I can't keep doing this anymore. Therapy hasn't helped, and medication robs me of the only dopamine infusion my hairy palms can bring. I just. Want. To die. I don't want to be a burden anymore.

I was so close to attempting suicide but in a moment of desperation I dumped everything on my mom in a text and now here I am, dropping out of college and planning the move back home. I'm dreading this because I honestly cannot stand living with my family. can someone tell me what to do. I was very close to taking a bunch of pills tonight. i knew it wouldn't be enough to kill me but i was so tempted to just do it. i can't keep living like this. I've completely given up and I don't care. I don't attend my college classes. I'm failing every course. I'm screwed honestly. I have commitments and responsibilities that I'm supposed to be doing but I can barely get out of bed. I live alone and I can't take care of myself. I'm just in a really bad place and I don't know what to do. Nothing is helping. And how do I get better when I don't care that I don't care about getting better? I was thinking about attempting just to be admitted to inpatient but the thought of my parents finding out makes me cringe. I've been suffering in silence for so long but I think I've reached my breaking point. Do I tell my parents I need to drop out for the semester, focus on getting better? But then they'll just say I'm depressed because I'm unemployed and I need to get a job. Do I move back in with them? Do I admit myself to the hospital? I'm stuck between life and death because I don't want to be alive but I can't follow through with taking my life. I don't know what else to do. I've been eyeing my pill bottles all day. I have nowhere near the quantity it'd take to kill myself but I'm seriously considering taking a good amount just to go to the hospital. I need help. Serious help. I can't keep up this act that I'm doing okay any longer. My parents\/family\/friends have no idea how bad of a mental state I'm in.

{"prompt":"'It\\'s been a lifetime of managing my suicidal thoughts and I\\'m up against a wall today. I never had a catalyst or anything for my depression or suicidal ideations. It\\'s just been present for a very long time. I\\'ve gone through prescribed regimens of medication, seen counselors, stayed active and healthy, made friends very easily, and just overall tried to keep myself out there and try or experience new things to see if I could find that calling in life for myself over my life. Things have generally gone very well for me in life other than the numerous times I let my suicidal thoughts get the best of me and I either let shit fall apart or an attempt on my own life puts me down a notch. This has been something that\\'s just always been present and feels very dominating as a part of who I am. It used to scare me and I used to want to feel better than this, but I just feel completely indifferent and empty to it and everything else in life now. I don\\'t have the energy to pretend I\\'m a normal person or talk to people, I don\\'t experience any emotions, all of my old hobbies and such feel like a chore, and I can\\'t envision wanting anything in the future. This \"depersonalization\" side of my suicidal ideations has been going on for a couple years now and more than ever I just can\\'t find any reason or desire to stay alive. I\\'ve been miserable for as long as I can remember and I know it\\'s not right, but, at this point I don\\'t know any other mindset other then feeling this way. I know how to be a decent human being, I do good at work and such, I\\'ve developed very close relationships in platonic and romantic senses before, but nothing makes it feel worth the effort at all.

I\\'m trying really hard to muster up the guts to hang myself tomorrow but the idea of the pain of it scares me a lot. I don\\'t wanna do some long life story explanation or anything. There isn\\'t much to talk about other than the fact that I\\'ve always had trouble finding enjoyment in anything and suicide is what I\\'ve wanted for as long as I can remember despite having no big \"catalyst\" issues or anything like that.\\n\\nLife has just felt like an empty experience for me despite how much shit I\\'ve done and how well I used to do in social settings. It never really felt worth it and I have trouble feeling attached to the idea of any of it.

A lot of my personal bills and what not are going to be due soon and I don\\'t have the money to pay them off whatsoever. I doubt they\\'d go to anybody at all, so I think it\\'s just a good time to try and kick the bucket, but I\\'m so scared of those few minutes of pain. I\\'ve tried a partial suspension hanging but no matter how much research I did and how many different positions and how tight I pulled my knot, I couldn\\'t pass out. I compressed my arteries for sure since I developed patchea on my face and felt intense pressure, so I\\'m not sure. I think I have to go for the full short drop and I\\'m scared shitless but there\\'s nothing else I can do at this point. The only thing motivating me for this job interview today is getting the money to buy a gun. I'm interviewing at a doomer job site - Miserable working conditions with it being a steel foundry that stays very hot, poor management, and very bad reviews from previous employees. It'll pay decent enough, though, and that's really all I need. If I stick it out for a couple weeks, I can afford a shotgun as opposed to a handgun so I don't have to be so worried about living through the attempt. My only big fear in life is the pain from making another attempt to hurt myself, and I think this will be a different approach to that. Wish me luck. Depersonalization makes suicide feel like the only thing I can do. I\\'m at a loss. No matter what\\'s going on in my life, whether things are good or bad, I just feel absolutely numb to it all. I used to be able to talk to people until I stopped wanting to put in the effort because it feels like a hassle. I can\\'t come up with goals for myself because everything just sounds like putting stress on my plate for the sake of stress. Literally anything I deal with gets turned around by my mind in the form of, \"why even bother with this when I could just kill myself?\". Depression has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember, but this new head rearing in the form of depersonalization took away any feeling of want. I left a 3 year long relationship, walked out of my job, and now I just sit in place all day long and do nothing. The only thing I feel is afraid of the pain of killing myself because I know how it can be with some methods and that\\'s literally all that\\'s stopping me.

My first job I landed retroactively changed the job description and pigeonholed me into a nightmare role. I landed another job through my very limited connections at my university, but I don't think I can land another. I've started off terribly on the wrong foot. I missed an email, I delayed HR by waiting too long to sign some papers, and now I got assigned to a team today. It's QA, which is not software dev, and out of fear of the same story as my previous company repeating, I cautiously agreed. but my boss pretty much told me he fucking hated me and that everything I've done so far has been wrong (which is true), so I'm on thin ice for acting so hesitant. This was a few hours ago. I sent an apology, and I've hit it of well with my new team, so no problems there. But I have a feeling of dread. I don't think I can land another job. If I lose this, I won't be able to pay rent. I don't have any friends bc I just moved to a new city. I haven't dated in years (I don't think I'm very attractive tbh, but this doesn't bother me that much). My family is nuts. I feel like I wasn't allowed a normal childhood, and I've spent my whole life trying to avoid being 'trapped,' but every time I make progress, I wind up worse off than before. I haven't been afraid of dying in a long time. I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen. But I don't see a way out, and I often feel things would be better if I didn't have to try anymore :\/ ->","completion":" indicator"}
{"prompt":"I've made an exit bag. It's also the first time committing suicide has actually really scared me as an idea. I guess I'll just be 100% honest. At 15, I took 120 extra strength aspirin pills. WebMD said it could lead to death. Sounded good enough to me. I remember being yelled at, being slapped, not being able to hear, not being able to stand, and the hospital visit after. At 21, I purchased a gun. It was my first time working with one. I did plenty of research and found where to aim it on my head to ensure I wouldn't be one of the \"lucky few\" to survive a shot to the head. The pain scared me, and even after I chambered my round, I didn't realize the slide wasn't all the way forward. It was off by maybe half an inch, so when I pulled the trigger, nothing happened. The idea of the pain nerved me out so bad that I couldn't go through with pulling the trigger again after I realized my mistake. People were looking for me and knew that I was a danger to myself, and eventually events led me to hospitalization. Just recently, I purchased rope. Strong enough to hold my weight, but I didn't think it'd need to. I read up on partial suspension hanging and thought I had the noose positioning right and everything. I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But, no matter how tight it was or how much I leaned into it, all I felt was the pain and pressure in my head with no sign of passing out coming about. I gave up, my face purple and blotched from the bleeding of every single blood vessel in my face. I knew a full hanging was too much pain for me to take. Today, I have an exit bag set up. I've done it perfectly, and felt absolutely nothing while preparing it just in the same way as I have for a while now in any situation in life. My lifelong depression evolved into depersonalization over the last year, and it's left me feeling so much less of everything. So empty. When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked. It shot out so much louder next to my ear than I anticipated. I know it won't hurt, or it's not supposed to, but my chest hurt anyways. I turned off the gas and just sat in shock. I don't really know how to feel at this point. I know that this method is surefire if done right (and I've done it right) but realizing the fact that there's nobody in my life anymore who I can even write some god awful angsty suicide note to hurts a little bit. Realizing that this is really it, absolutely for real something that fits within my fears and means feels so odd. I've fought with this for a long time and felt despair over my desire to die until I became numb to everything. Now I have it and I feel somewhere between lonely and anxious. I'm not sure what I'm asking for if anything here, but I'm scared of it failing and scared of dying at the same time. I'm sad that for the last while I've made decisions and actions that unintentionally or intentionally pushed the few people in my life away from me. I feel very alone and exhausted. ->","completion":" attempt"}
{"prompt":"'Bully payback help?.

On top of this is creating photoshopped images of my friend having fake conversations towards the bully and others to, I'm guessing, make her look bad. All my best friend has done is ask for her to leave her alone and this woman won't stop. Its going on 5 days now.

Fuck this. Do y'all want me to fucking kill myself?. I am tired. I feel like such a lost cause. Medicine doesn't work. Therapy didn't do shit. I'm a failure as a human being. I wish everyone would stop believing in me cause I doubt they're ever gonna be satisfied. All I am is a lazy sack of shit with a plethora of mental illnesses. Wish I could just die so everyone could move on and forget about me. Conflicted about killing myself. My childhood was dogshit. Abused for as long as I can remember which dates back to 3 years old and I've been suicidal since I was maybe 10. Been to the mental hospital on several different occasions and barely graduated because of my spotty attendance and lack of caring. Didn't go to college and was working while living at home with an abusive parent but eventually moved in with the love of my life. Things should be great now but they're not. I still have so much shit brewing in my head and a plethora of debilitating mental issues and I fear it's hurting my partner even though she tells me she completely understands and that she believes in me. She tells me I shouldn't beat myself up over my shortcomings, but I can't help but feel like she's just lying to herself and to me just to make me feel better. I love her so much but I don't want to drag her down. She has so much potential to amazing things in life but here I am sobbing almost every day with barely enough willpower to get out of bed.

The emotional ties I have to this world are unbearable but I'm just barely hanging on thanks to her being in my life but all this mental conflict is fucking killing me and my simpleton brain.

I imagine the scream from loved ones when they find out. I imagine the mental damage it'll cause. I imagine the lives it'll ruin.

{"prompt":"Covid makes it worse. I am in hell. I'm so alone, and that's true even when I'm amongst other people. I have insane abandonment issues, but simultaneously this painful feeling of inability to connect when people are open. When people aren't open, there is no learning experience, because ghosting doesn't tell you much about the situation unless you can figure it out on your own, and I mainly don't figure a thing out except to get more paranoid. Some people get ghosted looking for sex, and I'm not looking for that, and it makes me feel even sadder to not be looking for it. I just want to have some human connection. Honestly, most sex I've had was to try and have someone that felt they couldn't just leave me as easily. This is not a plea for attention, or at least not one that is a hope for salvation, just a warning. All that comes from places like this subreddit is people that feel saying \"don't kill yourself\" does something in itself. All that does is tell the person to wait for help that isn't coming. Saying that a person is dealing with a temporary problem or that things get better is sadistic when things tend to get worse. I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death. I don't want my head to explode via shotgun, because my father died without a funeral and I think for some people a closed casket is worse than an open one. But for handguns I'm too stupid to understand if a small caliber or large caliber really makes a difference if shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth. I've looked into other options, but they're even scarier - I think of Mark Linkous overdosing, but waking up paralyzed from his leg oxygen being cut off. A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again is the worst fate. This is all while my body is continuously accompanied by death. I'm nowhere close to dying, but the health issues I have make me so much lower than what I would consider a living person. Every morning I wake in pain, and most of the day is depression and physical pain, until the night that I spend in high anxiety about what dreams would come if I fall asleep, or maybe I'm just afraid of the people who rape you when you're vulnerable. It doesn't get better. If you are holding out for a miracle, no miracle is coming. End it now, the world has evolved to be tooth and claw, never ending pain, and people self righteous in sociopathy. ->","completion":" behavior"}
