I ended up trying to make a joke of it, then told her I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness, and changed the subject. Since then, it's really played on my mind, and it's not sitting well with me at all. Her words have really hurt me, it feels as though she has no faith in me. If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide, she could have just said \"I'm scared you're going to commit suicide\" and I could have tried to reassure her. But what she said was brutal. If I'd been diagnosed with cancer, rather than BPD and CPTSD, would she have ever dared tell me she thinks I'm going to die and would bet on it happening? I doubt it. So why does she get to say that? It's so thoughtless and hurtful. It's made me view her differently and I can barely speak to her.

It changes you into the kind of idle, infinitely distracted lazy looney you see so much on tv. Nothing can be bothered with anymore unless it's interesting, and almost nothing is interesting unless you're so hyperfixated on it that you can repeat the wikipedia page word by word. I lost my ability to socially relate, be a normal human being, when it happened. Everything they said about me at the time was 100% right. I really did try and look up girls' skirts. They did it in anime, and that was my obsession at the time. I was, and remain, an unstable freak. I was a creep, because that's how I acted. I reread the same books over and over like a madman. No wonder I was bullied so relentlessly. Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die, and it's never been far away from my mind since. I'm thoroughly scared of people. Not in meeting them, but in losing them. My best friend said it best: \"I deal with him.\" I alienate everyone. I say weird shit with no context that makes sense only to me. I offend people because I speak without thinking. Mom told me once that when she and dad got a divorce it'd be all my fault, and it was. It's always my fault. The worst part is that I was supposed to have every advantage. White, male, private school, rich parents and a full ride through college. No debt. I blew it. All of it.

Was given a job at mommy's office to stay out of trouble, and I was fired for being suicidal at the end of my 90 day trial period. Above all else, I'm lonely. I'm a creep. I long for something, someone, I could never receive on my own merits. Women, more than anything else on earth, terrify me, because I know I'm a short ugly bastard with no prospects and no social skills. I don't deserve anything, much less someone. Every relationship I've ever had has fallen apart within a month. I can't keep doing this anymore. Therapy hasn't helped, and medication robs me of the only dopamine infusion my hairy palms can bring. I just. Want. To die. I don't want to be a burden anymore.

I used to love making shit. I used to love trying and experimenting and wasting time because it wasn't a waste to me. But capitalism and instant gratification has irreparably fucked up my brain. I don't want to anymore. It wasn't supposed to happen to me but it did. I don't know where I want to go and what future I may or may not have. I don't know anything anymore. I hope I'll get out of this soon. But maybe I won't. And that's life too. Is it alright to work a corporate job you're content with and live a mediocre existence?

{"prompt":"Why was I born. My whole life I've been a failure. I've failed as a son, a brother, a boyfriend, a father, a employee, a friend, a grandson, a nephew and most recently I've failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all. I can't look my girlfriend in the eyes let alone find the courage to ask for help. I realized I haven't looked in the mirror in years because I can't stand the person looking back at me. Dont get me wrong I've looked at my clothes or my new haircut but I can't look beyond the surface. The facade I've built up is that of strong man and I'm so afraid to admit that I'm no longer him that I've shut myself out as much as everyone else. I haven't been to work in 4 days. I haven't even gotten out of bed. My girlfriend thinks I hate her because I can't find the words to tell her I want to die. My son who i lost custody of last year must wonder why his dad isn't there for him anymore but I don't think I can bring anything positive to raising him. My work must wonder whats happened to me, I just dissapeared without explanation but I'm guessing they've now given up on me like I gave on myself years ago. I drink, I smoke and I sniff my pain away because those are the only times I don't completely hate myself, but when I get a moment of clarity i despise myself even more. Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning but here I am a failure once again the worst part about it is as scared as I was I was content in knowing that if I was gone I wouldn't be able to let anyone down again. ->","completion":"at"}

I was compared to my neighbor's daughter a lot when I was younger. I guess my parents just thought it was an effective method of encouraging me to do better. While I did try to satisfy what they wanted in me, it never felt enough because they would keep doing it over and over again. It's like I had to always outperform the neighbor's kid or else they would just constantly compare me and berate me. It didn't help that she used to bully me and threaten me because her parents were our landlords and had more money than us.\\n\\nShe did become a better person later on and is much kinder now. But I always still felt like I had to compete against her because I hated how condescending her parents were towards me. They used to call me stupid and retarded and they made sure to hint that what they were saying about me was true because my brother turned out to be severely autistic, which they thought meant that both of us were lesser humans. Fuck them because I got into a top college while their kid didn't. I feel really bad for her, though because I know she grew up with a lot of pressure from her parents too. I would hear shouting from her parents all the time and she received harsh punishments for not meeting their expectations.\\n\\nI thought I would now be immune to anymore comparisons from my parents and her parents. Unfortunately not. I still have yet to pass my driving test and I've failed 3 times now. I was berated by my father and he told me he would give up on me and that I was stupid and worthless. It's like my admission to a top college no longer meant anything to him. Today I found out the neighbor's daughter passed her test on her first try and she even began driving lessons later than I did. Now all those negative thoughts are coming back. I havent felt such a hard blow to my self-esteem in a really long time. All of those memories are coming back and are living in my mind rent-free.\\n\\nI have a quiz, exam, and essay all due next week and I am just feeling so overwhelmed. I want to prove them wrong but with everything that's happening right now, I just feel so hopeless. I feel so stupid for letting their comparison get to me again. I hate being so weak-minded. I truly don't believe I deserve to get into the college I am currently enrolled in. Everyone here is so much more charismatic and intelligent than I am. I dont know what they saw in me and I feel foolish for believing I had a chance at succeeding in this school and in this life.\\n\\nI've been thinking about killing myself for a while and I even attempted to hang myself with my jump rope, but it was too weak and I chickened out. It feels so much more different thinking about suicide now because I know if I do end up succeeding, everyone will remember me as the pathetic girl who killed herself over her failed driving test. I used to think that those opinions won't matter once I'm dead, but the thought of that being my legacy just leaves such a bad taste in my mouth. I just feel at a crossroads right now and I dont know what to do. It feels so stupid to be suicidal over something as trivial as failing a driving test when other people around the world are going through much worse. I dont deserve to feel this way and I have no right to. I just wish I didnt give a fuck about what they thought but I was raised to be so dependent on my parents that I cant even function in the real world. Im too anxious to have a normal conversation with strangers face to face and even online.\\n\\n Ive done everything I could to get my parents' approval. Grades, awards, competitions, honors, distinctions, college. But I'll never be enough. I dont even think my parents support my intended career choice of being a genetic researcher. Im sure my dad wanted me to go into computer science but the field just does not interest me and im too dumb for it.

I cant get help for multiple reasons:\\n\\n1. My family does not believe in mental health\\n2. Im poor\\n\\nThats basically it. I cant even find a way to kill myself as painlessly and cleanly as possible. Amazon doesnt sell real guns, I dont think my jump rope will be enough to kill me, and i cant OD cuz it'll most likely not work and will just leave me in a coma or something.\\n\\nMy best choices so far are to bleed to death or to wait for a train to run me over. Im gonna go with the train option. Ironic because its right next to the dmv where I failed my driving test 3 times and is the biggest reason why I feel like shit. \", \"I dont think I want to die.

{"prompt":"'Are any of you familiar with forums where I can discuss methods?. removed. Something is wrong with me and I feel like I am an unsafe person now. Hi,\\n\\nI want to share something.\\n\\nContext- I am a deeply empathetic person and am very giving. My career has been devoted to helping others. I have a history of childhood trauma and adult sexual assault and domestic abuse. I have been diagnosed with CPTSD and depression and anxiety several times. I am trying. I am trying to heal and am doing all the things I am supposed to in terms of getting help. Another context is that I am an immigrant and my home country is unsafe for me- I am trying to appeal to remain where it is physically safe but I dont know if it will work. I hear back next month. I constantly have flashbacks, panic attacks that last hours, nightmares, and am struggling with eating and sleeping. It has been this way for a very long time. I have kept a log and I mean LITERALLY I have had less than 4 hours of relief during waking hours for the last 6 months CONSISTENTLY.\\n\\nI am unsafe- But I also think something in me is so damaged and broken that I am starting to hurt others. After leaving my abusive ex, I just cannot stop stalking them. I know I am harassing them but I dont know how to stop. This is not okay. I feel like I am behaving in ways that my abusers have towards me in some ways and I cannot stop. My brain just cannot stop fixating on them and I am trying so so so hard every day to keep myself busy and not bother them but I fail each time. I cannot describe the lengths I have gone but I will say that I am definitely causing suffering to this person.\\n\\nNext steps- I am planning to kill myself by the end of February if I cannot remain in a safe country and see improvement in my mental health. Partly because being physically unsafe is something I cannot tolerate again. And I will be unable to receive any treatment for whatever is damaged in me. I just want to say that I am sorry and I dont know how to fix myself. I am a mess. I am constantly in pain and now I am causing people I love pain and I regardless of how much I try, I can't stop. So I have decided to end things not just for own self but especially for others. I am not a safe person for others and I feel unsafe inside my skin. I have too many demons. I have everything planned out.\\n\\nRegrets- I just wish I could finish some of the research projects that can have large scale positive impact. I am a smart person, I have worked very hard to be who I am. And I really really wish I was not suffering so much that I am having to leave instead of finish some of the projects I know I can accomplish and improve lives of hundreds of people\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI am open to any insights.

I have been emotionally, and mentally tortured and driven insane by my family. Raped as a child. I have been diagnosed with so many disorders that the doc called it a little bit of everything syndrome. I closed myself off and played videogames, hiding from a world that already seems to hate me. I met a 14 year old on there who was weird and told me he was 17 about to be 18, and he would play flirt with me, joke around. So I would tease back. But we were never serious, nor would we ever be. Then one day after drinking, i told him he was hot and that if he was older, i would date him. I said some really stupid shit and i have apologized to him a 1000 times. He laughed it off and said dont worry about it. And admitted he was actually 14. I swear to god i am not like that, i am not attracted to minors, i swear i am not one of those kinds of people. I would never. It was never explicit or anything like that. We were only friends. Just friends. He's states away. But now I am driving myself crazy thinking I am a monster, and maybe I am.
