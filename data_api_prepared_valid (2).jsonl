{"prompt":"Today and tomorrow seem to blend into one another, devoid of any significance. The passage of days is almost imperceptible as I observe life unfolding outside my window, while I remain rooted in place. The relentless cycle of day and night continues endlessly, leaving me feeling trapped and motionless. I struggle to comprehend the drive that motivates others to pursue education, careers, and aspirations for the future – a yearning that has eluded me entirely. I feel like an outsider in a world where everyone else is making progress while I remain stagnant. It's as if I am afflicted with an incurable ailment or some fundamental flaw in my psyche that isolates me from those who share similar thoughts of self-harm. The emotional numbness clouding my existence for several years now has grown so pervasive that tears have ceased to flow from my eyes. I find myself contemplating ending it all, not out of malice but as a perceived burden to my family, who discuss me with a sense of discomfort and avoidance, indicating that they might be relieved in my absence. Convinced of my inherent oddness - physically and emotionally - I long for an escape from this unbearable reality; if only there were a button to erase every trace of my being without hesitation, I would press it without a second thought. Nevertheless, aware of the non-existence of such an option, the urge to either confront law enforcement with a weapon or seek solace in drugs as a means to end this suffering grows increasingly tempting despite the uncertainty shrouding my next move. Unable to discern a way out of this dark abyss, I see no other path than the one leading towards self-destruction. ->","completion":" be"}
{"prompt":"I find life to be so rife with paradoxes that it seems futile. I'm consumed by the belief that every aspect of myself is flawed, destined to endure solitude for the rest of my days. What exacerbates this sense of despair is the inner turmoil that suggests I shouldn't even be feeling this way. Outwardly, everything appears to be in order - a stable relationship with my family, a job to sustain me financially. Therefore, the responsibility for my desire to cease existing falls squarely on my shoulders. My disdain towards my physical appearance stems from a longstanding battle with weight issues; despite embarking on a weight loss journey, I still harbor intense dissatisfaction with my reflection. Every protruding curve and contour serves as a painful reminder of an inescapable reality. Compounded by gender dysphoria as a transgender man who has been undergoing testosterone therapy for two years yet remains misidentified by others, the convergence of body image struggles and identity crises amplifies my self-loathing to unbearable levels. Adding another layer to this self-deprecation is my sexual orientation - being attracted to men while also identifying as possibly asexual. It begs the question of who would ever consider entering a relationship with someone like me. The demise of my previous relationship, supposedly attributed to my transgender identity, was with another trans man who couldn't perceive me as masculine enough, reinforcing my insecurities about never being adequate. Being already at odds for not fitting into societal norms, coupled with not desiring a physical relationship, renders me an unsuitable partner across the board. While I don't harbor genuine intentions of ending my life, I can't shake off the belief that everyone around me would be far better off without having to contend with me; whether it's burdening my friends with incessant grievances or subjecting my family to the complexities of having a transgender child. I've become convinced that I am nothing but an embarrassment to those closest to me and unworthy of even basic human connections - from friendship and familial bonds to romantic love. ->","completion":" in"}

{"prompt":"I am currently facing some challenges at work where my performance has not been up to par, and I am worried about the consequences. Despite graduating college recently at the age of 21, I come from a rather unconventional upbringing due to my parents' strict religious and homeschooling beliefs. My ambition to break free from my small hometown in Appalachia led me to pursue software engineering. Unfortunately, my initial job experience did not align with what was promised as the role evolved into something I was not prepared for. While networking through my university connections secured me a new job opportunity, I fear repeating past mistakes.\n\nIn my latest role in QA, I have already made some errors due to my hesitation and lack of experience in this specific field. Although I have since apologized and established a good rapport with my team, I can't shake off this constant sense of dread. Financially, losing this job would mean struggling to make rent as I have no safety net in this new city where I lack a social circle or romantic connections. The dysfunctional dynamics within my family have added to the emotional burden as I have navigated through life feeling deprived of a normal childhood.\n\nDespite these challenges, thoughts of self-harm are not on my mind. However, the weight of hopelessness lingers as it seems every step forward only leads me further into despair. The idea that things might be easier if I didn't have to keep fighting is becoming more prevalent in my thoughts. ->","completion":" in"}
{"prompt":"I am on the verge of losing my job, as my boss holds animosity towards me, a sentiment I believe is warranted. At 21 years old, having completed college in December, I come from a background where my parents adhered to an extreme evangelical homeschooling lifestyle, one that was detrimental to my well-being. Despite working diligently to attain a degree and escape my small Appalachian hometown in pursuit of a career in software engineering, I've encountered setbacks. My initial job deceived me by altering the role description after I was hired, confining me to an undesirable position. With limited networking opportunities through my university, I secured another job; however, the rocky start makes me skeptical about landing another employment opportunity. An unfortunate sequence of events unfolded: missing important emails, procrastinating on HR paperwork which caused delays, and being assigned to a QA team today instead of software development - all stemming from understandable caution due to past experiences. Regrettably, my boss expressed disdain towards me and criticized my performance thus far (valid points), putting me on precarious ground for expressing hesitation. While I have connected well with my new team and promptly apologized for any misunderstandings with the boss, an underlying sense of dread lingers. The fear looms large that if I lose this job, paying rent will become impossible. Lonely in a new city without friends and without dating for years (attributed partly to low self-esteem), familial ties bring more chaos than comfort. Reflecting on a childhood devoid of normalcy as I strived to break free from limitations has only resulted in worsening situations each time progress seemed within reach. The thought of death no longer evokes fear in me; while not actively seeking it out as an escape route, at times, the notion lingers that perhaps everything would be easier if I didn't have to continue pushing forward :\/ ->","completion":" in"}

{"prompt":"Many tend to overlook the simplest ways to support a friend going through tough times. It's common for people to instinctively try to offer solutions and fix the problem when a friend is in distress or contemplating suicide. While suggesting that a friend seek professional help like seeing a psychiatrist can be beneficial, it's important not to overlook two simple yet powerful gestures that can make a significant difference: hugs and support. A genuine hug can be incredibly comforting and may be something your friend is in dire need of, regardless of their gender. Additionally, offering unwavering support without bombarding them with questions or unsolicited advice can go a long way in showing you care.

{"prompt":"Does anyone know of any communities where I can openly talk about coping strategies? Something inside me feels broken and I fear that I may pose a danger to others. Hello,\n\nI'd like to share something with you.\n\nBackground: I'm a highly empathetic individual and have always been dedicated to assisting others through my career. However, my past is marked by childhood trauma, as well as experiences of sexual assault and domestic abuse in adulthood. I've received diagnoses of CPTSD, depression, and anxiety on multiple occasions. I am actively working on healing and have been diligently seeking help. Additionally, as an immigrant, returning to my home country isn't safe for me, so I'm currently seeking permission to stay in a safer place, with the decision expected next month. I find myself constantly grappling with flashbacks, hours-long panic attacks, nightmares, and significant struggles with eating and sleeping that have persisted for an extended period. Keeping a record confirms that over the past six months, there have been almost no moments of relief during my waking hours.\n\nI feel like I am unsafe; moreover, there seems to be a part of me that is so fractured and wounded that it is causing harm to others. Since leaving my abusive partner, I've been unable to refrain from stalking them – a behavior that amounts to harassment which deeply troubles me. It's distressing to realize that my actions mirror those of my abusers towards me in some aspects. Despite my attempts to keep busy and steer clear of contacting them each day, I find myself failing repeatedly. The extent to which this obsession has consumed me is difficult to articulate but one thing is certain – it's inflicting suffering upon this individual.\n\nFuture plans: If I'm unsuccessful in securing residency in a safer environment or observing improvements in my mental well-being by the end of February, I am contemplating taking my own life. This decision stems partly from an inability to endure another period of physical insecurity along with the belief that without access to appropriate treatment, there's no hope for healing whatever pain resides within me. Regrettably, despite my sincere efforts at self-improvement, it appears that not only am I personally tormented on a daily basis but also causing anguish to those close to me; hence, for their sake especially (though not exclusively), making this final choice seems necessary as I perceive myself as a threat rather than a source of safety for others due to the multitude of demons within me.\n\nSorrowful reflections: If only I could see through completion some of the impactful research initiatives ahead of me! With intellect and hard work defining much of who I am today, it pains me greatly that instead of being able to finish these projects – projects capable of bettering hundreds' lives – suffering has reached such unbearable heights necessitating such drastic measures.\n\nI welcome any insights you may offer; understand that the fracture within me leads not just self-harm but potential harm towards others – these notions merely compound an already overwhelming agony. ->","completion":" be"}

Despite the conflicting emotions, deep down, there is love for my parents so strong that I'd sacrifice anything for them and the mere idea of being distant from them incites sorrow within me. However, their frequent outbursts shake me to my core. The triggers seem trivial and unpredictable; sometimes it's over minor details like finding a strand of hair on the floor.

It's evident that they care deeply for me; however, their inability to control their temperaments poses a significant challenge.\n\nI harbor a belief that perhaps if I were flawless by achieving top grades consistently and maintaining impeccable order in my surroundings while assisting more with household chores, the instances of uproar could diminish – albeit not disappear entirely. Despite being aware of this probable solution, it feels like an insurmountable task to accomplish. Some days even the act of getting out of bed feels like an immense struggle; as a result, I grapple with feelings of inadequacy.\n\nAcknowledging my shortcomings is crucial; improved self-discipline is something that eludes me at times. Managing anxiety and depression has been made slightly more bearable through medications such as Adderall and Paxil — they have undoubtedly alleviated some of the challenges associated with social interaction and academic responsibilities. Nonetheless, just when I start feeling relatively stable, a wave of uncertainty washes over me once more.\n\nWhile faith sustains me during tumultuous times, there are moments when even my belief in God feels distant and inaccessible. Your patience in reading through this reflection is sincerely appreciated; sharing these thoughts brings some relief amidst the absence of someone available for conversation. ->","completion":" id"}
{"prompt":"I often find myself wishing for an end to everything and harboring resentment towards my parents. It confuses me why these feelings persist when objectively, my life seems fine. I reside with my parents in a comfortable home supported by their financial means. Possessing things I desire is a luxury I enjoy. Moreover, my immense love for my two dogs further complicates these thoughts as I fear for their well-being if anything were to happen to me. Currently enrolled in college, though not excelling, I am on track to graduate in two years which should enable me to secure employment and move out. Moments of disdain towards my parents emerge sporadically despite the love and admiration I hold for them. Their outbursts over trivial matters, often seemingly random, intensify these negative emotions within me. Notably, their tirades mostly revolve around minor issues like stray hair on the floor rather than poor academic performance. Reflecting on this behavior leads me to suspect that my mom might be struggling with OCD tendencies. Deep down, I am aware of their affection for me; however, their inability to control their yelling poses a continuous challenge.\n\nThe notion that achieving perfection is the only solution to quell their outbursts lingers in my mind - striving for flawless grades, impeccably clean surroundings, and increased household contributions might lessen the frequency of their anger, although not eradicate it entirely. Yet, mustering the energy required for such feats feels daunting; some mornings even getting out of bed proves arduous leading to delayed starts and feelings of inadequacy. Recognizing my shortcomings and struggles with self-discipline further fuels this sense of failure within me.\n\nAlongside battling anxiety and depression daily, relying on medications like Adderall and Paxil has undeniably eased some burdens by facilitating social interactions and aiding in academic pursuits. However, a paradox persists - just when stability seems within reach, turmoil grips me anew. While faith in God remains a cornerstone of solace for me, instances arise where His presence appears distant.\n\nTo anyone who has taken the time to read through these musings: thank you sincerely as it offers a fleeting moment of relief by unburdening this weight from within me. The absence of a confidant leaves this platform as my only outlet for expression amid this turbulent journey I find myself on. ->","completion":" id"}

{"prompt":"I feel as though death would be a kind fate that I haven't earned. Suicidal thoughts have plagued me for years, even though I was only recently diagnosed psychologically. I didn't want to burden my parents with the steep costs of psychologists and psychiatrists in my country. I must admit that I am an involuntary truant when it comes to appointments with my psychologist and school counselors for the same reason – they can't charge me if I don't schedule appointments in the first place. The idea of ending my life has become a constant companion over the years, almost turning into a twisted hobby by now. In my idle moments, I have pondered and planned nearly every imaginable method to achieve this within the confines of my home during quarantine. From calculating how much isopropyl alcohol it would take to induce a slow, painful death by poisoning to testing the sturdiness of potential hanging points, or even contemplating stepping in front of a speeding car (though quickly dismissing this notion as not wanting to cause trauma), I have explored various options meticulously. I've even strategized ways to ensure that my family wouldn't find me midway through attempting suicide before succumbing.\n\nIt seems like my lockdown hobby has turned into ideation, finding solace in these macabre thoughts. The root of it all is simple – self-loathing. I cannot find it in myself to love or value who I am. Despite admiring the beauty and wonder in others as innate human beings, which automatically captivates me, all those positive feelings fail to extend towards myself. Instead, words like idiot, disappointment, coward, failure, damaged goods, hypocrite, emotionally stunted, man-child, degenerate among others flood my mind when vulnerability takes over – which feels like almost constantly these days.\n\nMany assert that this phase will pass — but no way. Despite reaching out to friends and family who earnestly attempt to reason with me and dispel these irrational thoughts, their efforts only seem to amplify my guilt for causing them worry needlessly; being not worth their concern adds another layer of self-condemnation. Seeking professional help was an option until the exorbitant fees made continuous visits unattainable; coupled with diminishing effectiveness of medications due to cost constraints.\n\nAttempting various hobbies and revisiting once-beloved passions led nowhere particularly this year since losing my mother early on has left me with nothing but anxiety and self-reproach – striving solely to make her proud served as my guiding light until she departed.\n\nThe support mechanisms that might have worked earlier now feel ineffectual; every day is a struggle without relief in sight. Despite having detailed plans and numerous approaches for ending it all at hand yet not following through stems from feeling unworthy of such an easy escape while blaming oneself for inflicting hurt on others precludes any mercy upon oneself or cessation from suffering.\n\nThough admiring those who choose death through their volition out of a wish not to endure anymore feeds contrasting emotions on whether such an option is viable given how much pain has been caused by oneself towards others — thus mandating continued suffering as penance seems only fair despite its toll.\n\nWhether this reasoning stands strong enough against suicidal impulses remains uncertain; nevertheless serves as a present anchor keeping me intact amidst turmoil.

{"prompt":"I am struggling with the demands of my job but feel trapped and unable to quit. Lately, thoughts of suicide have been creeping into my mind. In summary, the physical toll of working in retail has taken a serious toll on me, yet I can't afford to stop because my family would disapprove. My life feels stagnant, and all I crave after work is rest. I put in all this effort for minimal pay, only to have a significant portion taken by my mother. I can't predict if or when I might consider taking drastic action, but the idea has been haunting me lately. It's like ending my life would only be a slight variation from the daily grind I'm enduring. While I don't want to come across as playing the victim, it seems like circumstances were stacked against me from the start. Growing up in a household of single women, raised by a single mother, has left me feeling stunted. The job I'm stuck in is unpleasant and physically damaging due to the transportation involved. My body doesn't even have time to recover before the cycle begins anew. The compensation isn't worth it, especially when a substantial chunk goes towards bills and necessities like healthier food due to family habits. Each paycheck barely leaves anything in my bank account by the time bills are covered – it's disheartening. And while I acknowledge my share of responsibility in this situation too, it feels like I'm carrying not just my burden but also that which should belong to potential husbands or boyfriends in their eyes instead of being encouraged to build my own future family. They don't even anticipate me leaving! It's frustrating being 27 and about to turn 28 soon yet feeling utterly stuck and broken down physically. This constant strain makes it hard for me to maintain a regular fitness routine as before. If I were to consider moving on from this situation, my mother would perceive it as quitting without seeking other opportunities – a misconception that exasperates me greatly. Everything remains unchanged, so what's the point of getting out of bed each morning? The environment around me doesn’t seem conducive to progress; perhaps leaving sooner rather than later is the best course before things deteriorate further with no sign of improvement on the horizon. ->","completion":" id"}

{"prompt":"I'm overwhelmed by everything bottling up inside me, reaching a breaking point. The weight of my emotions is becoming unbearable, and I fear that if I continue to suppress them, I may resort to drastic measures. It's challenging for me to confide in anyone; whenever I attempt to share, it either ends abruptly after revealing a fraction of my feelings or with me pretending that I'm fine now. Only one person makes me feel at ease enough to open up, inexplicably so. Surprisingly, she happens to be the mother of a popular girl and a teacher whom I've known for most of my life, albeit distantly. Despite having acquaintances who have known me for years, I struggle to open up to them or even to strangers. My attempts at seeking help from others often end with me falsely claiming that everything is resolved when deep down, it's far from it. After an unfortunate experience opening up to a certain teacher previously, where I felt like a burden for venting about my struggles while she has her own life and responsibilities, I withdrew completely. The thought of suicide looms over me constantly now, though the timing remains uncertain as I'm hesitant due to my loyal dog who relies on me. Prolonged silence has led others to believe that I am coping well when in reality, I am drowning in despair. Feeling lost and hopeless, the idea of keeping everything bottled up until succumbing to suicidal thoughts becomes more tempting each day.

The weight of it all is becoming unbearable, and I fear that if I continue bottling it up, the outcome might be drastic. It's challenging for me to confide in others; whenever I attempt to, I only share a fraction of what's truly bothering me before withdrawing or falsely claiming that I've overcome my struggles. There's only one person I feel comfortable opening up to, and I struggle to understand why I can't find that same level of trust with anyone else, not even my own mother. This individual happens to be a teacher who is also the mother of one of the popular students at school—a person I've known for most of my life. Engaging in conversations with other teachers or strangers proves fruitless as I inevitably downplay my issues and assert that everything is fine when it isn't. Despite once trying to confide in a particular teacher for about four months, our interactions led me to feel ashamed and burdensome for sharing my ongoing troubles while she had her own responsibilities to attend to. Apologizing profusely, I vowed never to trouble her again, a promise which led me to withdraw from seeking help from others altogether. Regrettably, I've come to terms with the idea that ending my life is imminent. The persistent thoughts and urges have consumed me; although not immediate as I couldn't bear abandoning my dog. It's been a while since I last reached out to anyone, leaving everyone under the impression that everything in my life is stable when it truly isn't.

{"prompt":"\"I am planning to end my life in a few hours. As November 14th approaches, I can't help but feel that my time to depart is drawing near. Since I began reaching out here back in June, I've allowed myself ample time to succeed, yet here I am faced with failure. Every aspect of life seems to have slipped through my grasp, leading to resentment from my parents, abandonment from my family, and a lack of friendships. The reality of the life I once dreamed of living feels like a distant fantasy reserved for an elite few – a life that was never meant for me to achieve. In my circumstances, suicide seems like the only viable option. It's as if I never should have existed in the first place, and now as someone plagued by numerous afflictions, I've endured a period of desolate emptiness for far too long. Everything has been stripped away from me – belongings, finances, aspirations – leaving me with nothing but the impending void of death. While tomorrow someone else will revel in a grand celebration surrounded by loved ones and gifts, I'll be alone in my room with a fatal wound. The life I yearned for will continue on in someone else's reality long after my departure. My only wish is to remain undiscovered as I decay in solitude within these walls.\"\n\n\"I wish making preparations for death was easier. The process has proven to be far more arduous than anticipated – not just emotionally but also practically concerning possessions, finances, and sentiments. Despite composing nearly twenty letters, it weighs heavily on me that there may be no one to read them. I've tidied up my surroundings, closed redundant accounts, noted down login details for the remaining ones, and intend to withdraw my savings tomorrow if possible.\nContemplating having to undertake these tasks at the age of 70 is daunting and serves as another reason driving me towards suicide – who would want to navigate such arrangements during their twilight years? The fate of my belongings troubles me; envisioning my money being allocated to charity alongside valuable items like electronics brings me some solace despite lacking familial legacies to pass on. While mentally prepared for death without reservation, a part of me remains apprehensive about the disposition of what little wealth I possess.\nI empathize with individuals grappling with suicidal ideations who are swayed from their course by familial or social responsibilities; conversely, it has always been my intent to end my own life. Strangely enough, it appears that circumstances have aligned over time making suicide an increasingly feasible option for me—culminating in relinquishing all ties so completely that concerns about family or friends holding me back no longer register.\nDevising the method through which I will end my life hasn't been as challenging because those are simply plans on paper; however, when the day arrives this Saturday and actions are set into motion, it will likely be an entirely different experience altogether. Though navigating through preparations and setting things in order has proven taxing thus far, it stands as the final task awaiting completion before bidding adieu to this existence; may death come more easily than this current ordeal.\"\n\n\"In an unexpected turn of events,I am likely facing expulsion from school come tomorrow! Today marked a deliberate sabotage on my part—I opted out of state exams knowing full well about my impending suicide tomorrow. With a string of neglect leading up until now where work remained untouched,I am fully aware that this might be the final straw culminating in expulsion.Yet strangely enough,the prospect brings a sense of relief - finally receiving what feels like just retribution.I can only hope that these last moments are filled with even more anguish and suffering.''\n\n\"As Saturday draws near—the day on which I have planned to take my own life—I find myself torn about whether or not writing farewell letters makes sense.I'm looking forward to departing this world,yet pondering over loved ones being left in the dark unsettles me simultaneously.Writing notes might offer closure,but could potentially inflict further pain upon those dear to me.Should I reach out one last time or spare them from such torment?\" ->","completion":" be"}

{"prompt":"I'm struggling to understand what's happened to me. It all began about 7 months ago when I was just 17 years old. I had a mishap at a friend's lake house in April while playing on a tire swing barely 2 feet off the ground. Despite falling directly on my back, initially, everything seemed normal. However, that night I started feeling unwell and fatigued, although I didn't experience any major symptoms at that point.\n\nA couple of days later, back home, I started feeling a bit off, with a persistent fogginess clouding my mind. A week passed before I consulted my regular doctor who promptly diagnosed it as a concussion. The symptoms persisted unchanged and led me to seek advice from a neurologist who suggested it could be post-concussion syndrome. Oddly, I didn't display the usual signs of a concussion, only this persistent haziness in my head.\n\nAs the discomfort lingered, I turned to a chiropractor for help without any success. As summer drew to an end, I tried unwinding through golf but found no relief. In fact, things took a turn for the worse as the fogginess in my head transformed into a sensation akin to having hot water swirling inside my skull—exceedingly uncomfortable.\n\nIn desperation, I consulted a naturopathic doctor with expertise in natural remedies who was confident in alleviating my symptoms. Multiple tests were conducted including MRI scans and x-rays of my back and neck regions alongside CT scans upfront. Seeking further aid, I visited a concussion clinic briefly but discontinued as treatments yielded little improvement.\n\nAt my mother's suggestion, I turned to CBD oil which unfortunately exacerbated my condition causing severe inflammation in my head instead of relief.\n\nSubsequently, another naturopath recommended consultations with vision specialists yielding no significant findings except for indications pointing towards anxiety. Following this lead, I commenced Cymbalta treatment gradually but still without much success despite escalating doses from 30mg to 60mg down to 30mg again.\n\nFeeling despondent at the lack of progress despite numerous attempted remedies and interventions leaves me feeling lost and hopeless. Even after identifying low vitamin D levels through neurotransmitter testing and correcting it with supplements brought no respite.\n\nMoreover, revelations of elevated cortisol levels likened to those induced by stress or fear further compound this baffling situation adding more distressing symptoms: tightness around the face and temples, stiffening neck muscles, zapping sensations across head and temples coupled with persistent itchiness around the eyes escalating when seated or resting against surfaces causing discomfort.\n\nAmong these uncomfortable manifestations stands out an incessant sensation of heat and inflammation within my head accompanied by an unsettling moving sensation not providing any respite unless exposed to extreme cold like snow or through cold showers which afford temporary relief but regrettably prove short-lived as symptoms resurface upon returning indoors ensuring no lasting ->","completion":" in"}

However, the scars from these traumatic experiences are all too real. All I truly desire is to find individuals who can offer genuine love and acceptance. Relying heavily on my faith in God, I remain hopeful and steadfast in my beliefs.\"\n\n\"The impact of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has been devastating, to the point where suicidal thoughts plague my mind. Firstly, I urge against trivializing my struggles as they have profoundly affected me. This torment began five years ago at 15 when incessant diarrhea attacks became a daily ordeal during high school. Constantly excusing myself to rush to the restroom became routine until medical evaluations diagnosed me with IBS-D and revealed its incurable nature. An overwhelming fear gripped me regarding potential embarrassing incidents in front of classmates which ultimately led to my withdrawal from school and subsequent failure due to persistent absences. Transitioning to a distance education program was a compromise that allowed me to progress academically; nevertheless, the repercussions have left me feeling as though my life has been shattered beyond repair. Alienated from social connections, abandoned by former friends who made no effort to reach out during trying times, I grapple with feelings of regret over what seems like wasted teenage years — fueling dark thoughts of self-harm.\"\n\n\"The night brings forth heightened feelings of despair as suicidal ideation creeps into my mind more prominently during those solitary hours when attempting early sleep becomes essential as a deterrent against dangerous impulses.\"\n\n\"The enduring trauma stemming from cyberbullying continues to haunt ->","completion":" id"}

I am currently experiencing a profound sense of well-being, and I hope this positive state endures. While I may never have conventional relationships due to lingering issues, such as my tumultuous relationship with my mother who continues to inflict physical harm on me even at the age of 20, and the lasting impact of past bullying episodes that have left me deeply fearful and anxious. Despite these challenges, my optimism lies in the prospect of building a life independent from my mother with support from my father. Though haunted by past traumas, all I truly desire is to find acceptance and love from others. My steadfast belief in God provides me with hope for the future.\"\n\n\"The relentless trials of dealing with IBS-D and OCD have taken a severe toll on my mental well-being to the point where ending my life seems like the only way out. It may seem trivial at first glance, but please refrain from mocking my struggles as they are undeniably real. The onset of these issues began five years ago at age 15, marked by incessant diarrheal episodes that disrupted my daily life, particularly during high school when I was plagued by constant fear of public humiliation due to unpredictable bathroom emergencies. This led to severe anxiety that eventually forced me into isolation, causing academic setbacks and a sense of failure which linger even now at age 20 despite making some progress towards recovery. The scars left behind by this ordeal include a lack of social connections, compounded by the abandonment I felt when none of my former friends attempted to reach out. Regret fills me as I dwell on the lost opportunities during my formative years, intensifying suicidal thoughts within me.\"\n\n\"The nighttime hours heighten my suicidal ideations, prompting me to seek sleep early as a means of escaping these dark thoughts.\"\n\n\"The aftermath of cyberbullying continues to haunt me relentlessly. A year ago on our country's most popular forum site, derogatory remarks such as 'shit' and 'cock' were hurled at me mercilessly by peers.

{"prompt":"I recently obtained my driver's license after a year-long delay caused by paperwork issues, which also impacted my ability to get a permit. Although I was initially thrilled to finally have my license and looked forward to the freedom it would bring, I'm still not allowed to drive anywhere, including to work. Despite passing my driver's test a few days ago, my mother believes I am not ready to drive independently. She insists that I wait for up to a year due to car insurance concerns and other reasons she deems important. Her lack of faith in my driving abilities is disheartening, especially considering the effort and dedication I put into practicing for months leading up to this moment. The fact that she doubted me before the test and continues to restrict my driving privileges has left me feeling frustrated and trapped. It's particularly upsetting because I had hoped that obtaining my license would grant me more freedom and allow me to share this milestone with friends, yet it seems like everything has been taken away from me. The current situation has left me feeling overwhelmed and despondent, making me question the value of continuing with this kind of disappointment and lack of trust. ->","completion":" id"}

I'm unable to contribute meaningfully to my mother's well-being. My efforts to improve have only resulted in crushing disappointment - rejected job applications and a disconnection from my true passions. My aspirations seem unattainable, leading to wasted resources, strained relationships, and feelings of inadequacy within my family.

However, I'm feeling remarkably positive. Coming to terms with the realization that someone I deeply cared about may not be toxic but simply lacking in intelligence and unworthy of me has been a turning point.

{"prompt":"One day, I feel like ending my life. I'm a high school student and recently found out that I've been deferred from my dream university. I had pinned all my hopes on college as an escape from the struggles I've endured for so long. What even is life to me? It feels like something that doesn't belong to me. The fact that MY parents are both abusive and financially controlling, leaving me feeling trapped without money, a driver's license, or any real friends, makes me see myself as a complete failure, worthy of disappearing. I am the person everyone at school ridicules, even during online classes on zoom where my stuttering led to mockery from everyone - including my crush, the only person who somewhat resembles a friend in that class, and even my teacher. The disdain from them and my parents compels me to want to vanish entirely; despite not seeking their pity or wanting them to realize their impact on me, all I yearn for is an escape to some remote forest and fade away quietly. The only thing preventing me from taking drastic action is the sliver of hope for admission into a college far away with a full scholarship, allowing me to sever ties with everyone from my past life.

{"prompt":"I feel as though I should not exist. This might not fit in here, as I am without any specific plans and doubt my ability to carry them out, but the overwhelming feeling remains that I am unworthy of life. My internal dialogue is filled with self-criticism - I perceive myself as a self-absorbed complainer who lacks the will or desire to take the necessary steps to improve my situation. Rather than seeking improvement, my actions only serve to frustrate those who may wish to see me succeed. I express grievances about my loneliness, yet fail to reach out for support. Even if I were to seek help, would it truly make a difference? The weight of my sadness and feelings of uselessness consume me, making me believe that I have become a burden over an extended period of time. Deep down, I almost wish for someone to obliterate me, symbolizing the worthless existence I believe myself to have. Despite recognizing the kindness of strangers attempting to aid in my recovery, part of me resists their efforts as I remain fixated on the belief that there is no path towards improvement; this is simply how things are meant to be. I harbor this profound self-loathing due to a conviction that I am a horrendous individual at my core and that my depression is justified. Acknowledging my flaws is something not just evident to me but also visible to those around me who care enough to notice.

{"prompt":"I'm seeking advice on how to deal with a situation where my close friend is facing severe harassment and bullying from an unfamiliar woman. This individual has not only been targeting my friend with hurtful comments like 'do the world a favor and go kill yourself,' 'when I find you, it's gonna be the end of you,' and repeatedly calling her derogatory names related to her weight, but she has also gone as far as creating manipulated images showing fake conversations involving my friend and others, presumably to tarnish her reputation. Despite my friend's simple request for this woman to stop, the harassment has persisted for five days now. The aggressor has resorted to creating 17 different Instagram accounts, using seven different phone numbers so far, and establishing two Facebook profiles solely for harassing my friend, causing significant mental distress to her. Consequently, my friend is feeling worn out and refuses to engage in basic self-care activities or socialize; she seems quite overwhelmed by the situation. It is disheartening that despite reaching out to the authorities, they have advised her not to respond in any way, leaving her feeling helpless. The individual perpetrating this bullying presents herself as a reverend, therapist, witch, light worker, healer, and personal trainer—an unsettling combination of roles.

I've given it my all time and time again, hoping for a breakthrough, but it just never seems to come. The weight of despair is unbearable; thoughts of ending my life plague me daily. I have everything prepared – the note, sorting out bills, even writing up a will. I've reached out before, trying to keep an open mind about what the future might hold, yet nothing seems to change.

This condition has been a constant in my life, and contrary to what was believed, it hasn't improved with age; in fact, it has worsened significantly. It has led me down a path where I struggle to focus on anything unless it captivates me intensely. My social skills have deteriorated, and I find it hard to connect with others in a conventional way. Looking back, the criticisms directed at me were painfully correct - my behavior indeed took on uncomfortable and inappropriate undertones at times. My interests became obsessions, leading to being labeled as strange or even creepy by those around me. The repetitiveness in my actions caused me to be a target for relentless bullying during my middle school years, causing me to articulate feelings of wanting to end my own life for the first time. Since then, those thoughts have never strayed far from my mind.\n\nInteracting with people petrifies me not at the initial meet-up but rather the fear of losing those connections later on. My interactions are often awkward or offensive due to speaking impulsively without filtering my words. I've unintentionally pushed away almost everyone in my life. Even my own mother once blamed our family issues on me following her divorce from my dad. It's an ongoing narrative where mistakes and regrets constantly swirl around me.\n\nDespite starting off with significant advantages - being white, male, attending a private school with affluent parents who funded my education entirely - I've squandered every opportunity that came my way.

Waking up one day with a pleasing visage would have drastically alleviated the excessive mental burden required just to make it through each day in this world.\nA significant portion of my cognitive faculties would have been liberated…it truly saddens me how much potential remains locked away due to this circumstance.\nUnfortunately, these circumstances have transformed my character into one consumed by misery...revealing how undesirable my presence has become around others.\nWhy couldn't fate have blessed me with beauty from birth?\n\nStatements like \"beauty lies in the eye of the beholder,\" \"there's someone out there for everyone,\" or \"even if you think you're unattractive, you could be someone's ideal match\" seem rather hollow now...especially when faced with being universally deemed unappealing.\nThis invisible status among people fills me with loathing and despair - surgical intervention remains inaccessible currently at 17 years old and financially strapped...coupled with an overwhelming fear of potential risks involved…the idea just terrifies me beyond measure.\n\nI'm surrendering myself to this existence.' ->","completion":" in"}

It seems like those in this community are only scratching the surface of what I endure, never truly reaching the depths of my despair. Solely consumed by hopelessness, I have contemplated drastic actions such as sabotaging vehicles each night as a form of protest against the prohibition of self-ending. The idea of going on a reckless spree before ending my life has occupied my thoughts. In retrospect, opting for assisted suicide might have been a more logical choice before reaching this breaking point, yet tonight, I am determined to slash every tire within proximity.\n\nThe offer of a taser from a friend now serves as a means for me to make an attempt on my own life. Feelings of intense hatred towards every person I've ever crossed paths with intensify my desire to escape this world, especially fueled by negative emotions associated with Drake Bell.\n\nDespite encountering someone who has brought an unprecedented level of joy and understanding into my life recently, I find myself unable to cope with these newfound positive emotions. The overwhelming comfort and connection shared with this individual only highlight the stark contrast to the years of alienation and mistreatment experienced from others in my past. The thought that such happiness was missing all along is too much for me to bear, leading me back to thoughts of self-annihilation.\n\nPrior to this pivotal encounter, I had been contemplating ending my life alongside train tracks as a train passed by. Even with feelings of desperation about the perceived hopelessness within America and its societal structure, there is a faint glimmer of hope in starting afresh in Japan where values align more closely with my ideals. However, limited resources hinder this potential relocation as debt continues to loom over me due to financial struggles even when working as a rideshare driver in America.\n\nThe unconventional lifestyle of living in a bus and constantly shifting between parking lots has left me emotionally drained from the profound isolation it brings.

Those of you on this subreddit can only scratch the surface of my pain. The darkness seems endless, and it's suffocating.

The idea of assisted suicide feels like it would have been a more humane choice than what I am contemplating now.

My disdain for everyone I've ever known runs deep, exacerbated by insignificant triggers like Drake Bell. This world has proven itself to be unbearable and utterly dreadful.\n\nHopelessness engulfs me entirely, making suicide seem like the only viable option left for me as I struggle to accept any love or positivity offered.\n\nYesterday, meeting the most amazing friend who showed me genuine care and affection should have been a blessing, but it has only intensified my pain. Despite her presence illuminating my life in ways never experienced before, I find it unbearable because it starkly contrasts with how others treated me throughout my entire existence.\n\nFinding solace next to train tracks while contemplating suicide was my reality before she appeared in my life.

This new connection should bring joy, yet it tears me apart inside. After 28 years of being neglected and mistreated by others in my life, realizing what real companionship feels like has shattered me. The thought of starting fresh in Japan with even a slim chance at happiness sounds appealing, but the lack of resources to move my RV there makes it nothing but a fantasy for now.\n  My issues seem intertwined with America's flaws rather than being solely mine; living in a society that prioritizes values like art, labor, education, and public health seems like a dream unreachable here.\n- As a rideshare driver in America for four years straight, each year brought financial loss instead of gain—a stark contrast to what might be achievable as a taxi driver in Tokyo where bills could potentially be met comfortably.\n  Trapped in the confines of my mobile home and constantly shifting from one parking lot to another brings an unbearable level of loneliness that chips away at my sanity every moment.

Currently at 19, my life seems to be spiraling out of control. Losing both my mom and dad (Mom almost four years ago and dad nearly five years ago) has left a deep void in my heart. Despite being subjected to mental and physical abuse by my mother - whom I still hold no resentment towards as she grappled with her own mental health battles - I miss them dearly. My dad was absent from my life since I was around 11-12, his passing a result of a car accident while my mom's was due to health complications like sleep apnea and an enlarged heart.\n\nMy first attempt at suicide involved using a phone charger when I couldn't find any rope, overwhelmed by feelings of hopelessness. Following that incident, I made a promise to myself that I'd enlist in the military and meet death in combat. However, upon moving in with my aunt and uncle, things took a different turn for me. Despite doing well academically and receiving praise for my strength from friends and family members, deep down I felt like everything I achieved was simply riding on the support and love of others.\n\nWhile everything seemed to be going smoothly for a while, once college started, things began to unravel rapidly. My academic performance plummeted, and it became evident that my dependence on others had caught up with me. Struggling with maintaining good grades while dealing with missed classes and assignments, there's now a real risk of losing my job.\n\nDespite multiple suicide attempts, the thought of how much pain it would inflict on my family always holds me back. Each day feels increasingly difficult to bear; recently being arrested for possessing shrooms (a felony where I live) added another layer of turmoil as I spent two nights behind bars. Now, the only way to prevent further deterioration is by improving my grades - an uphill battle given the mess I'm in.\n\nI rarely open up about how I truly feel; every time someone asks if I'm okay or inquires about my well-being, I lie through my teeth. The emotional toll is immense, reaching a point where death seems like the only solution to bring my family closer together after feeling like all I've done is create trouble and push everyone away.\n\nSince moving out from living with my aunt and uncle onto campus life seems to be looking up for their family now that I am not there anymore.

I've been treated poorly, forced into financial burdens while working a meager job just to meet basic needs like dental care. Meanwhile, my sister, who never pursued higher education, was prioritized over me without regard for the toll it took on my well-being. My own feelings are disregarded time and time again; the moment I express any form of distress, I'm met with accusations of betrayal and hurt from my mother.\n\nI survived meningitis and lost my hearing in one ear during that ordeal. Yet when I try to share my trauma with my mom, she dismisses it with comments like \"Relax, you thrived\" or \"Don't blame your father.\" It's frustrating beyond words. There are countless instances where she chose to overlook or trivialize my pain instead of offering the support I desperately needed.\n\nMoreover, dealing with an abusive situation involving my older sister's boyfriend further exacerbated these issues within the family dynamic. Despite reaching out for help, I was left to fend for myself in a toxic environment where mistreatment was normalized.\n\nSchool isn't much respite either; being surrounded by an overly vocal far-left social justice warrior culture leaves me feeling alienated even though my political views align more moderately left. The constant blame thrown at entire groups of people for societal issues only adds to the toxicity that surrounds me. Trying to express this to younger peers who are deeply entrenched in their beliefs is an exercise in futility.\n\nThe life I envisioned has been marred by familial turmoil - a consequence of decisions made without considering the impact on my well-being. It feels like every sacrifice made in loyalty has only led me deeper into this mire of suffering and regret. ->","completion":" id"}
{"prompt":"I'm really struggling and feeling completely hopeless. Dealing with the aftermath of being sexually assaulted is tearing me apart, especially because my family doesn't believe or support me, leaving me feeling vulnerable and constantly triggered. The thought of returning home until January 19th fills me with dread, and I wish more than anything to break free from this torment. I've been trying to find a way out on my own, but the overwhelming sense of being trapped by both my emotions and the people who have hurt me is suffocating. It's like I have no other option but to remain in a house where my mom is obsessively religious and overly protective of my autistic sister.\n\nAdding to this already unbearable situation is the weight of past traumas inflicted by my family. My mom showed little regard for my well-being when she pressured me into buying a car while I was struggling with a low-paying job, on top of dealing with car accidents and insurance issues. Meanwhile, my sister, who never pursued higher education and only had a casual job at McDonald's, seemed to receive more attention and resources, leaving me feeling neglected and unheard.\n\nThe emotional burden further escalates as I try to express my pain to my mom, only to be dismissed or silenced. It's incredibly frustrating how she downplays or ignores the distressing experiences I've been through, including surviving meningitis and losing my hearing in one ear. Instead of offering support or validation, she minimizes these traumas or shifts blame elsewhere.\n\nThe lack of empathy within my family extends beyond personal struggles as well. They fail to acknowledge the harm caused by abusive relationships within our midst and tend to prioritize their own comfort over addressing toxic behaviors affecting others. It's incredibly isolating to feel disregarded in such circumstances.\n\nMoreover, external factors exacerbate the distress I'm already facing at home. The prevailing radical attitudes on social justice issues at school often come across as alienating, especially when I consider myself moderately left-leaning rather than adhering strictly to extreme ideologies that assign blame collectively based on identity markers like race.\n\nFeeling distanced from both my family dynamics and social circles due to differing perspectives adds another layer of complexity to an already complicated situation. The missed opportunities for a normal life compounded by familial expectations have taken a toll on my mental health.\n\nReflecting on past choices made under duress for the sake of family harmony only magnifies feelings of regret and resentment towards those who influenced such decisions. The sacrifices made in pursuit of maintaining peace within the family have left deep scars that may take time to heal.\n ->","completion":" id"}

{"prompt":"Why should I continue to hold onto hope? My life so far has demonstrated that happiness was never meant for me. I've learned to temper my expectations and not get excited about anything because it always ends in disappointment. The cycle of striving for my goals only to fall short has become painfully clear. Spare me the empty reassurances that things will improve - I've been at this for a long time now. People say to give it time and remain positive, but let's cut the pretense. The truth is, I feel a deep desire to end it all. Each time I allow myself a glimmer of hope, the subsequent failure cuts even deeper. If only I could numb my emotions, perhaps then I could find contentment in whatever little life offers me.\n\nMy childhood was marked by suffering - bullied by friends and physically harmed by my parents, it's no wonder I struggle now. These experiences have taught me that trusting others is futile; even those closest to you will betray and cause pain if you don't conform to their expectations. Trusting myself seems like a joke when I see how much havoc I've wreaked in my own life. Admitting that I've inflicted pain on others only adds to the self-loathing.\n\nThe idea of relationships is tarnished for me as well. No woman has ever shown interest in me, and while it may seem trivial, the rejection cuts deep. Being taunted about my virginity by others made me feel inadequate, pushing me to fabricate stories just to fit in with friends who mask their manipulative nature with camaraderie.\n\nThe concept of family feels hollow; existing solely because two individuals procreated does not equate to love or support. The beatings under the guise of discipline from my father, like being punished for not tying shoelaces correctly at a young age, leave scars that transcend physical pain.\n\nSo what reason do I have to keep going? Family? The ones who brought me into this world but failed in raising me? Friends? Those who tormented and expected conformity rather than acceptance? Love? Only a distant dream as I watch others experience connections that elude me at every turn.\n\nThis existence feels like an unbearable burden, one where the end appears more inviting with each passing day than enduring this cesspool called life. ->","completion":" id"}
{"prompt":"What's the point of holding onto hope anymore? My life so far has demonstrated that happiness was never meant for me. I've learned not to expect too much or get excited about anything because things never improve, and my goals seem unattainable. Spare me the false reassurances that things will get better for sure. I've been trying for a long time, but it just doesn't ring true. I find myself wanting to end it all. Every time I dare to hope for something, the eventual failure only amplifies the pain. If only I could numb my emotions, maybe I could settle for whatever scrap life throws at me. My childhood was a nightmare; perhaps that's why I'm so messed up now. Friends bullied me, and my parents were abusive, teaching me that no one can be trusted – not friends or family because they will betray and harm you if you don't comply. I can't even trust myself; after all, I'm the one sabotaging my own existence. I've done terrible things too, like bullying others to feel superior. It's hypocritical of me to condemn friends and family for their behavior when I've been just as bad. Maybe I deserve to suffer, but why don't all my so-called \"friends\" suffer as well? Perhaps it's time to make them suffer too. No girl has ever been interested in me, and while it may seem petty to lament over relationships, it runs deeper than that for me – finding companionship isn't as simple for me as it is for others.\n\nPeople care more about my lack of sexual experience than I do myself and have ridiculed me over it, prompting me to lie about it to fit in with my friends who are nothing more than manipulative parasites. You need them to stave off loneliness but have to conform or face bullying by them if you don’t fit their mold.\n\nThe idea of anyone genuinely caring about me at this point seems like a cruel joke. If only I were asexual so that dealing with romantic relationships wasn't even a concern.\n\nFamily holds no true meaning; they are simply two individuals who decided to procreate – sure, they claim to love me but the beatings were just \"discipline,\" right? Should I be grateful for the beatings with belts whenever I couldn't tie my shoes at eight?\n\nShould I also express gratitude knowing they might cut ties with me in the future because of our differing beliefs? Unconditional love appears conditional if you don't conform. Well, submission is not an option – death seems preferable.\n\nFriends? Family? Love? What should keep me hanging on? Family – those who brought me into this world without knowing how to raise me properly? Friends – those who tormented and pressured me into being someone else against my will?\n\nLove – something beyond reach as other guys effortlessly outshine me in every romantic pursuit' This existence feels like an unbearable mess called life'My demise might arrive sooner than expected.'' ->","completion":" id"}

The prevalent societal obsession with cultivating a distinct personality and adhering to notions of moral virtue is exhausting. It seems everyone desires you to conform to their expectations.

My nerves are constantly frayed, and I am always teetering on the edge, ready to unleash fury at the slightest provocation regardless of the circumstances. I genuinely fear that my current state could eventually lead me to commit a serious crime that lands me in prison. It seems like my only options are to seek help by admitting myself to a psychiatric ward after informing an emergency room about my suicidal intentions or succumb to those thoughts and take my own life. As I ponder over this decision while still at home, I am leaning towards the idea that it would be best for society if I were to remain confined indefinitely. With no family to speak of, there would be no one affected by my absence. The financial aspect weighs heavily on my mind - how will I manage the costs involved? It is quite possible that one day, I will meet a tragic end in obscurity like countless other nameless individuals living on the streets who end up cremated without anyone mourning their passing.

Many of my past intimate encounters were driven by a desperate need for reassurance that the other person wouldn't easily walk away from me.\n\nI wish to clarify that this expression is not a cry for attention, or at least not in anticipation of a miraculous intervention. Rather, it serves as a somber cautionary message. The often-repeated refrain of \"don't end your life\" from online communities like this one only offers false hope, delaying the inevitable reality that help may not arrive in time.\n\nThe notion that one's struggles are temporary or that things will eventually improve feels agonizingly cruel when faced with escalating difficulties. My profound ineptitude at managing life has led me to dread contemplating the act of ending it all. I am haunted by visions of violent means like firearm-related suicide due to the haunting memories of my father's funeral-less passing.\n\nAs I grapple with these dark thoughts, contemplating other methods only fills me with dread – recalling instances like Mark Linkous' overdose-induced paralysis instills a deep fear of surviving a suicide attempt yet being left permanently incapacitated. Concurrently, my body is plagued by relentless health issues that reduce me to a mere shadow of what I consider living.\n\nEach day begins with excruciating physical discomfort and spirals into hours filled with both emotional anguish and bodily pain. Nightfall brings little respite as anxiety about impending nightmares or fears related to vulnerability consumes me – thoughts laced with horror about potential violations while unconscious.\n\nThe hope for eventual improvement feels futile; there are no miracles on the horizon. Embracing the harsh truth of an unrelenting world marked by suffering and an ever-present callousness among individuals seems increasingly inevitable. Should you linger in anticipation of a savior's arrival, prepare for disappointment – swift resolution might be the kindest choice amidst this evolving landscape fraught with perpetual anguish and people unapologetically entrenched in their self-righteous indifference towards others' suffering. ->","completion":" be"}
{"prompt":"The ongoing challenges of dealing with Covid have magnified my already intense feelings of despair. Despite being surrounded by people, I find myself engulfed in a profound sense of isolation. My deep-seated fear of abandonment clashes with an overwhelming sense of being unable to establish meaningful connections, especially when others are not forthcoming. Ghosting, a common occurrence these days, offers little insight into the reasons behind it, leaving me increasingly paranoid and unable to decipher the situation. While some individuals may engage in casual encounters seeking physical intimacy, my longing is purely for genuine human connection, making the lack of it even more disheartening. Much of my past intimate experiences were driven by a desperate need to prevent someone from easily walking away from me.\n\nThis is not a cry for attention with hopes of rescue; rather, it's a stark acknowledgment of my current state. The responses typically found in forums like this one - generic encouragements to stay alive - provide no real solace or solution. Waiting for help that may never materialize only adds to the existing anguish. Suggestions that one's struggles are temporary or that conditions will eventually improve seem almost cruel considering the bleak reality that things often worsen instead.\n\nNavigating life feels so daunting that contemplating death becomes frighteningly confusing for me. The mere thought of using violent means such as a handgun triggers painful memories related to familial loss and leaves me grappling with technicalities about calibers and entry points – thoughts I find distressing and bewildering. Other methods hold an even darker aura; recalling stories like Mark Linkous's tragic experience shows how surviving a failed suicide attempt can lead to a fate worse than death – perpetual disability coupled with unfulfilled desires for release.\n\nMeanwhile, my body betrays me daily as I struggle with relentless health issues that have stripped away my vitality and left me feeling like a mere shell of who I once was. Each morning unfolds in agony, paving the way for long hours consumed by sorrow and physical suffering until nightfall ushers in anxieties about nightmares or worse - fears of vulnerability leading to exploitation by manipulative individuals.\n\nThe prospect of things improving seems elusive; any hope for miraculous intervention feels futile in a world where pain reigns supreme and moral decay runs rampant among seemingly righteous individuals devoid of empathy. If there's any lingering expectation for salvation, it's time to let go - our environment seems engineered for perpetual suffering and survival at any cost. ->","completion":" be"}

{"prompt":"Seeking support. It's been a challenging month since my partner of a decade unexpectedly left me on my birthday. Without warning, they simply packed their bags and announced they were leaving, leaving me without closure or understanding of the situation. Enduring both physical and emotional abuse from her, I've kept silent about it due to the emasculating stigma associated with being a male victim. It's difficult to admit that my female partner has been violent towards me during our arguments at home. Despite her urging me to seek therapy for years, I finally made the brave decision to start therapy during the pandemic. As I strived to better myself and improve my mental well-being, she seemed to resent the positive changes in me. Now in my thirties, I feel devoid of purpose, especially after losing all my friends along with her departure, leaving me utterly isolated.\nIn search of solace, I embarked on a journey across the country to be with family but found little comfort there as it only exacerbated my mental anguish. Ironically, I found more peace when I was alone with just my dog in my car with nowhere specific to go. Regrettably, I have ceased taking my prescribed medication and turned to heavy drinking again after almost a year of sobriety. Today marks the end of my Ativan supply, which has been crucial in preventing a downward spiral for me.\nI harbor doubts that my psychiatrist will refill the prescription, pushing me closer to what seems like an inevitable end. There are moments when I wonder if some individuals are destined for suicide as their ultimate fate, and lately, that notion is becoming increasingly acceptable to me. Sadly, due to immense fear of being institutionalized if I express these thoughts openly with my therapist or psychiatrist, I am forced into silence – knowing that even if I were committed involuntarily, I'd likely disguise my true feelings and intentions just to escape eventually; this deceit would only intensify my suicidal contemplations.\nThe concept that those who once professed love for me could cause such profound pain is incomprehensible. Perhaps there exists a sense of karmic retribution in play here; believing that nature is signaling an end might seem easier than grappling with why this suffering has befallen me.\nI hold no expectations for responses or readership; this act of reaching out stems from sheer desperation as loneliness consumes me completely. ->","completion":" id"}
{"prompt":"Desperate plea for support. It has been a month since my partner of a decade unexpectedly departed on my birthday, leaving me without any explanation. Abruptly packing their belongings and announcing their departure, I remain without closure or understanding of the situation. Despite enduring physical and emotional abuse from her, I never confided in anyone due to the shame associated with admitting that my female partner was violent towards me during our arguments. She had persistently urged me to seek therapy, a step I eventually took during the COVID-19 pandemic to work on self-improvement and mental well-being. However, she seemed to resent the positive changes in me and ultimately left. Now in my thirties, feeling devoid of purpose and abandoned by both her and the friends she took with her, I am at a loss. Seeking solace with family by embarking on a cross-country journey only accentuated my struggles as it aggravated my mental health rather than providing comfort. Prior to this turmoil, I found peace in solitude with just my dog alongside me on the road. Regrettably, I have ceased taking my prescribed medication and resorted to heavy drinking after a long period of sobriety. Consuming my last Ativan today, I am aware that it had been crucial in preventing a complete breakdown thus far. Doubts linger regarding the possibility of acquiring more from my psychiatrist, leading me to contemplate that this may be the end for me. It seems as though for certain individuals, suicide emerges as an ordained fate; a notion that strangely offers me some semblance of peace now. Ironically, sharing such dark thoughts openly with either my therapist or psychiatrist is not an option due to fear of being forcibly institutionalized which would only intensify my desire for self-harm as evading such circumstances lies within my nature. The realization that those who ostensibly loved me could inflict such profound pain leaves me questioning if perhaps karma has caught up with me or if I have unknowingly invited such adversity upon myself. Nature's subtle cues appear to suggest that it is time for me to embrace death willingly as penance for an unknown transgression or misdeed.

{"prompt":"I am seeking assistance. I have been battling suicidal thoughts for approximately a decade. While I have tried to distract myself with jobs, short-term relationships, and other activities, the underlying feelings persist. In the past couple of years, I have found myself looking for reasons to push away those close to me – it's like a \"you're out if you do this\" scenario. As a 35-year-old male, I recognize that my family and friends would be devastated by my absence, yet it feels like no one really cares at present. I often feel excluded or that I bring down the mood whenever I am included in social gatherings, almost as though I exist in a separate dark realm where everything feels disconnected.\n\nI have reached out to hotlines and online chats for support, which provides temporary relief for a night or a few weeks. Despite seeking help from medical professionals and being referred to mental health services in the UK, I find their responses patronizing and unhelpful – their sympathetic tones and generic questions about hobbies sound insincere. Consequently, I have stopped engaging with them altogether.\n\nI am aware that my actions would cause immense pain and guilt among my loved ones if I were to take drastic steps. Still, living in this current state feels unbearable – it's like slowly decaying in isolation in my flat with minimal contact from others. The thought that it might take up to two months for anyone to notice my absence weighs heavily on me. It is unsettling how easily I've distanced those who once mattered to me; now contemplating drastic measures seem more plausible.\n\nReflecting on past interactions with a non-professional psychologist regarding intrusive thoughts years ago reinforces my concerns about how far things have progressed. The idea of making plans for something so final frightens me deeply; even choosing a remote woodland location and strategizing about alerting passersby before taking any action highlights the gravity of my situation.\n\nDespite being told that this current mental state is temporary and triggered by recent events, these feelings of despair are cyclic – they ebb away momentarily only to resurface later on. It's akin to teetering on the edge constantly; just one more setback could potentially push me over that edge.\n\nRegarding my personal analysis: starting from a troubled childhood characterized by violent tendencies, self-harm behaviors like scratching and punching myself, along with bullying others including my own siblings indicates deeper psychological issues that were possibly overlooked by psychologists due to clever deflection on my part at the time - leaving my parents shocked by typical reassurances of normalcy at each evaluation.\n\nConsidering the possibility of suffering from some form of psychosis or schizophrenia alongside bipolar disorder, there's an eagerness within me to confirm these suspicions through concrete medical tests involving hormonal imbalances for bipolar disorder detection or specific diagnostic procedures for schizophrenia - although despite all these years of grappling with dark depressive episodes no definitive diagnosis or treatment plan has been established.\n\nExpressing myself accurately during consultations with medical professionals or mental health specialists seems challenging; often feeling misunderstood or overlooked adds another layer of frustration to an already complex situation.\n\nThe form of aid sought:\nWhile acknowledging that an accurate diagnosis cannot be provided solely through online interactions or written descriptions without professional evaluation, receiving even a semblance of guidance would be invaluable for validation - suggesting potential conditions such as bipolar disorder along with appropriate medication recommendations (preferably specific ones available in the UK).\n\nAdditionally, recognizing the need for a shift in perspective highlights the necessity of finding literature that can offer insights into reframing mindset patterns or enhancing coping mechanisms - any suggested reading materials aimed at promoting personal growth or understanding emotional struggles would be highly appreciated.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my narrative and offering your support where possible.\nTo anyone experiencing similar sentiments: please engage in dialogue as vocalizing emotions can provide solace even when shared anonymously through platforms like chat hotlines.\nLastly, let us all exercise empathy towards others; abstain from passing judgment on individuals facing hardships as you never truly comprehend their internal battles nor what led them down their current path. Extend kindness wherever possible - your small acts could mean everything to someone else silently fighting their own battles amidst turmoil.\nWarm regards,\nTom ->","completion":" be"}
{"prompt":"I am in desperate need of assistance. For the past decade, I have been battling suicidal thoughts that persist relentlessly, despite my attempts to distract myself through work and short-term relationships. Lately, I have found myself seeking reasons to eliminate those close to me from my life – if you cross a line, you're out. Being a 35-year-old male, I am fully aware that my family and friends would be devastated by my actions, but it feels like nobody is paying attention right now. I sense a profound disconnection, as though I am merely existing in a dark, invisible realm. While I have sought help through hotlines and online chats, the relief they offer is fleeting. The suggestions from professionals seem insincere and unhelpful; their sympathy sounds forced, leaving me alienated. I understand that my actions will have long-lasting repercussions on those around me when I eventually go through with it, yet I can't bear the life I currently lead. It seems like I am slowly decaying in isolation within the confines of my apartment – it might take months before anyone notices my absence. Nobody consistently checks up on me; rather, it is me who reaches out to them.\n\nA few years ago, outside of a professional environment, I confided in a psychologist about my intrusive thoughts. His response was to only worry once those thoughts turned into actions. Although I haven't taken definitive steps towards ending things, the ease with which I have distanced myself from significant individuals scares me. Moreover, deciding not to carry out this ordeal at home further highlights the extent of my isolation - contemplating secluded woodlands for such an eventuality and planning on leaving warning notes for unsuspecting dog walkers reveals the depth of my despair.\n\nDespite being considered bright and articulate by others and acknowledging that this current state of mind is temporary influenced by recent events – one that will eventually pass in a matter of days or weeks – it does not negate the certainty that such feelings will resurface cyclically. What's worse is feeling constantly at the brink - just one misfortune or provocation away from plunging over the edge.\n\nReflecting on my own history paints a troubling image: an antagonistic and self-destructive pattern since childhood involving violent outbursts directed at myself and others accompanied by intimidation tactics towards family members and siblings. Although consultations with psychologists during that period failed to flag any serious concerns due to my ability to mask issues with wit and intelligence - something seen as normal much to my parents' dismay.\n\nQuestioning broader mental health concerns such as psychosis, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder further complicates matters - wondering if hormonal imbalances detect bipolar disorder or whether there exists a test for schizophrenia fuels a desire for validation via medical tests. Despite never having received diagnoses or medications for these conditions nor for persistent dark depressive episodes underscores a significant gap in understanding mental well-being.\n\nSeeking guidance presents another hurdle: obtaining advice remotely may not yield definitive diagnoses or treatment options but perhaps could hint at possible conditions deserving attention or suggest suitable medications (considering UK regulations). The necessity for rejigging one's mindset surfaces as pivotal; hence recommendations for literature aiding perspective shift or coping mechanisms become crucial requirements.\n\nTo all who have followed this narrative thus far: any form of support extended is deeply appreciated beyond words can express. For those who resonate with these sentiments - conversing openly about your struggles alleviates burdens even if directed at an anonymous ear via helplines. Finally, let us all endeavor to be kind in our dealings with one another; withholding judgment allows space for understanding each individual's unique journey shaped by unseen battles fought along the way.\n\nI extend heartfelt thanks for your time and any potential support forthcoming. And remember – a simple act of kindness towards a stranger holds immeasurable power; never underestimate how your warmth and empathy could potentially brighten someone else's day significantly through mere acknowledgment or a genuine smile.\n\nBest regards,\nTom ->","completion":" be"}

At 35 years old, I am acutely aware of the devastation my family and friends would face if I were gone, yet it seems as though no one truly comprehends the depths of my despair at present.\n\nFeeling like an outsider in even the most inclusive gatherings, it's as if a dark veil envelops me, rendering me invisible and disconnected. While I've reached out to hotlines and online chats for relief, their solace proves fleeting. Although I followed through with visiting my GP as advised and was subsequently referred to a mental health team in the UK, their responses felt insincere and unhelpful, leaving me feeling dismissed and misunderstood.\n\nThe prospect of causing lasting pain for my loved ones upon my departure weighs heavily on me; however, the thought of continuing to exist in this debilitating state is equally unbearable. Confined to my flat, I fear it would take weeks before anyone noticed my absence. The lack of regular check-ins from others leaves me always as the initiator of contact.\n\nReflecting on past encounters with psychologists, informal ones at that, I disclosed intrusive thoughts which elicited a response indicating concern only when those thoughts translated into concrete plans for action. Despite never acting on these impulses in a physical sense yet silently orchestrating unsettling preparations for my potential demise in a secluded woodland setting, including leaving cautionary notes for unsuspecting passersby.\n\nMy unconventional behavior during childhood - marked by violent outbursts and self-harm - alongside being deceitfully cunning likely kept psychologists at bay from clear diagnosis despite suspected conditions like psychosis or schizophrenia mingled with suspicions of bipolar disorder. Amidst this turbulence, no medication or formal diagnosis ever materialized.\n\nFrustrated by what feels like an inability to effectively convey the gravity of my experiences to healthcare providers thus far has left me searching for clearer answers or avenues for psychiatric testing not yet explored by medical professionals.\nIn dire need of guidance and possibly medication tailored specifically within the UK's healthcare system.\n\nAmidst this tumultuous period, guidance on potential literature or resources that could assist in reframing my mindset or coping mechanisms would be greatly appreciated.\nThank you for taking the time to read through this lengthy narrative; any support extended is invaluable.\nTo anyone grappling with similar struggles: reaching out is crucial - be it to a hotline volunteer or even an anonymous online interlocutor.\nAnd finally, a gentle reminder: kindness towards others can be transformative - you never truly know the battles someone else is silently fighting.

Despite managing to keep myself occupied with jobs, brief relationships, and other distractions, these thoughts persistently linger. Within the last 2 years, I have found myself seeking reasons to push away my loved ones - one wrong move from them and they are out of my life. At 35 years old, I am aware that my family and friends would be devastated by my actions, but at the moment, it feels like no one truly cares.

Reflecting on my own past behavior — characterized by violent tendencies since childhood including self-inflicted harm through scratching or punching myself along with targeting and tormenting both siblings and parents — rings alarm bells within me.\n\nDespite encountering several psychologists during childhood due to concerning behaviors displayed then (even bullying other children), none provided a diagnosis as my ability to mask inner turmoils with wit convinced them otherwise - much to the horror of my parents receiving clean bills of mental health reports for their child time after time.\n\nConcerns loom over potential psychosis coexisting alongside suspected bipolar disorder accompanied by schizophrenia symptoms notwithstanding never receiving formal diagnoses or medication prescribed for addressing these underlying issues exacerbating my depressive state further . My dismay grows further given there appears an inadequacy in effectively communicating the depths of anguish endured when interacting with medical practitioners or mental health professionals alike.\n\nYearning for guidance towards possible avenues leading towards diagnosis impending professional consultation proves challenging yet crucial at this juncture .

If only I didn't have loved ones caring for me, the urge to end it all grows stronger. Do others resonate with feeling inadequate and unworthy of existence? Day after day marked by monotony and disengagement, merely staring blankly at a screen. Resolute in my desire to break free from this existence tarnished by despair and self-loathing, consumed by a fear of feigning it all; perhaps that's all there is – a yearning for release from this ordeal. Lack of ambition or foresight beyond completing high school with minimal effort; indications aligning with what my physician suspects to be Asperger's syndrome – it seems plausible given my struggles with spelling and recent personal losses in 2020 leaving me with little affinity for life at 17; dismissing assertions of being too young to feel this anguish is dismissive and infuriating as realities paint a grim picture of either desolation or eternal dependence on my mother ahead; long-standing plans of ending it once I hit 18 loom closer come November—fed up with the grip of inefficacious depression plaguing me incessantly; envisioning bleak horizons when asked about future endeavors during consultations; confined within chilling surroundings following the heater malfunction amidst plummeting external temperatures—further exacerbating feelings of self-loathing and suicidal tendencies amid physical discomfort; consumed by self-revulsion yearning for an early departure plagued by perpetual despondency—a plea to let go where solace seems improbable.\" ->","completion":" id"}
{"prompt":"I'm unable to share what's on my mind, so I'll just express it in the comments. There seems to be a restriction. Is there a particular song someone else plans on listening to before making a drastic decision? It feels like I don't want to continue. Does anyone have a specific song they associate with suicide? The term \"suicide watch\" almost feels ironic, as this platform appears more like a space where those struggling with suicidal thoughts come together rather than offering genuine support. I've previously engaged here under a different account but withdrew due to realizing it's not much more than individuals contemplating ending their lives. At this point, I might as well be another spectator. Is life worth living if joy seems elusive? Suffering consistently for an extended period, swallowing countless pills hasn't altered anything for me. The outlook seems bleak, self-loathing reigns, and the thought of causing pain to those who care for me is agonizing. Have you ever felt like such a complete failure that breathing seems undeserved? Each day blends into nothingness; monotony rules, and the desire to vanish grows stronger. This existence is unbearable; self-hatred consumes me entirely. Doubts cloud my mind – maybe I'm fabricating these emotions; all I yearn for is an end to this suffering. Drained of motivation and hope for what lies ahead, my academic path looks blurry with barely passing grades in high school and uncertainty about college. Being diagnosed with Asperger's by my doctor seems fitting given my struggles with spelling and the loss of my grandmother among other losses in 2020 have shattered me. Although just 17 years old, hearing others remark 'you're too young to feel this way' enrages me since I can clearly envision where my life is headed – down a dark road or perhaps tethered to my mother for eternity. Thoughts of ending it when I turn 18 have lingered for far too long; November approaches swiftly marking that milestone for me. The weight of non-functional depression crushes me, enough of this endless struggle. A hypothetical conversation at the doctor's office about where I see myself in five years offers no optimism – quite the opposite actually mentally hanging from the rafters seems like where I may end up instead. The sudden absence of heat with temperatures plummeting outside adds yet another layer to my already overwhelmed state – cold physically and emotionally while despising 90% of who I am, longing for an early departure from this torment called life which offers no reprieve from ceaseless agony - each day feeling heavier than the last.' ->","completion":" id"}

Is there one you'd like to hear before it all ends? Feeling like I've hit rock bottom. Anyone else have a specific song in mind for moments like these? This subreddit is often referred to as \"suicide watch,\" where we observe those in distress before they take their own lives. I used to engage here under a different username but found it unhelpful, just a platform where individuals discuss their suicidal thoughts. Unfortunately, my own might lead me down that same path soon enough, so consider me yet another person contemplating suicide. Is life worth living if it brings no joy? The despair lingers, despite the numerous pills I consume – they offer no solace. My prospects seem bleak, and self-loathing consumes me. If only I didn't have loved ones caring for me, perhaps then I could end it all. Do you ever feel so inadequate and worthless that you believe life isn't meant for you? Another monotonous day passes by with nothingness, lost in endless screen gazing. This existence feels unbearable; self-hatred clouds every thought. Am I merely pretending? All I desire is an end to this suffering. Motivation and hope for the future elude me; college seems beyond reach, struggling even to pass high school. The suspicion of Asperger's hangs over me; it explains a lot – poor spelling skills and the void left by losing my grandmother and everything precious last year. Despite being just 17, my outlook appears grim; don't tell me I'm too young for such thoughts; my destiny seems destined for failure or tethered to my mother indefinitely. Turning 18 soon in November has been synonymous with my planned exit strategy for quite some time now – fed up with this dysfunctional depression narrative plaguing me daily. In response to the five-year question: \"Probably dangling from the rafters.\" The heater malfunctioning amid freezing temperatures outside further exacerbates my despair; cold physically mirrors how internally frozen and loathing-filled I am – despising 90% of who I am within this perpetual suffering – yearning for an early departure from this agonizing existence claiming every waking moment as its own - pleading silently: \"Let it end; things won't improve.\" ->","completion":" id"}
{"prompt":"I'm feeling so trapped. Hi, you're a stranger to me but I thought maybe venting here could help. Recently, my family had a major fallout where all our issues came to a head. I've been battling suicidal thoughts for about six years now, having made an attempt when I was 14 and barely surviving. Since then, there have been a few other close calls but no success. Returning to my home country only landed me back in the same struggles. My girlfriend has been my rock through all the pain, but my family doesn't approve of her. They used to run a school for those unable to afford their visas, and when they found out about us, they shut it down and she had to leave. Despite our strong desire to be together, we're stuck in what feels like an impossible situation. Unable to save up enough money to visit her in Australia due to my current circumstances, I haven't even told my family that we still keep in touch. It's disheartening; I'm losing sight of any purpose as I strive for happiness yet find myself as nothing but a desolate young person confined in a dimly lit room hoping for some positivity in my life. Watching others progress with their lives and share moments with their partners while expressing how much they miss them only adds salt to the wound. Nevertheless, I cling onto the hope that someday we'll overcome all obstacles and truly be together despite the trials we've faced during our year-long long-distance relationship with just three months spent physically together before she had to leave.\n\nNavigating life becomes incredibly challenging when you belong to a Christian family convinced that being with her contradicts God's will – I believe in a God who would endorse love, yet the decision isn't mine to make. The desire to move forward is dwindling within me; it's been quite a journey but it appears this world may not be my destined place after all. The inability to go even if I desired is heart-wrenching; picturing her tears simply shatters me from within. Feeling stranded and isolated, all I really want to express is this – cherish your loved ones; that individual you would move mountains for – clutch onto them tightly because life is fleeting and not everyone gets that fairy-tale ending that we yearn for.\n\n\n ->","completion":" at"}
{"prompt":"I am finding it hard to keep going. Hello. While we are strangers, I feel like sharing my thoughts here. A major argument just erupted within my family concerning our various issues. I have been dealing with suicidal thoughts for the past six years, and I made an attempt when I was 14 that I barely survived. Since then, there have been a few instances where I came close but did not go through with it. Returning to my home country has only landed me back in the same struggle. My girlfriend has been the one person who has supported me through all the pain, yet my family does not approve of her. Initially, they were running a program to assist those who couldn't afford their visas, but when they found out about her, they shut it down, causing her to return home. Despite our strong desire to be together, it feels like an impossible situation. The financial constraints prevent me from visiting her as I am unable to go back to Australia right now. I haven't informed my family that we still keep in touch. The situation is unbearable, and I no longer see a reason to continue trying to pursue happiness when all I seem to be is a solitary individual in a dimly lit room waiting for something positive to happen. Watching others progress with their lives after dropping out of school is disheartening - seeing them happily united with their partners while they express how much they miss them only adds to the pain. Despite everything, deep down inside, I cling onto the hope that someday we will finally be united even amidst these challenges. We have sustained a long-distance relationship for a year now and spent three precious months together before she had to leave. It's tough navigating life with a Christian family who believes that being with her goes against God's will; however, I hold onto the belief that God, who created love itself, would indeed approve of our connection despite it not being in my control. At this juncture, I truly do not feel like carrying on any longer - although it has been quite a journey for me, perhaps this world is just not meant for someone like me. Being immobilized and unable to proceed even if desired is truly excruciating; thinking about her departure brings immense pain and leaves me feeling utterly alone and trapped within myself. Ultimately, all that strikes me is this: cherish your loved ones - that special person you treasure above all else - because life is transient; as far as my experiences go, not everyone gets that fairy-tale ending in the end ->","completion":" at"}

The revelation that my fiancé's indifference has been confirmed is the last straw. The time has come. While I'm uncertain about the exact method, obtaining a gun has crossed my mind as an option. Uncertainties linger, yet there's a creeping conviction that this is inevitable. The toxicity of this job is driving me to dark thoughts relentlessly.

Today, I dared to open up to him about my suicidal thoughts provoked by work's unbearable demands—it was met with disappointment rather than understanding or comfort. While he suggested speaking with his boss, I refused out of fear of being an added trouble, yet deep down yearning for his support which never came. My mother's concern seems limited to the scope of my shortcomings, failing to grasp the depth of my depression or self-destructive tendencies beyond how they reflect on her through my job performance failures. It appears that by distancing myself from my fiancé, his lack of response now hints at his detachment and lack of compassion towards my visible distress and cries for help.

The weight of being labeled a failure is crushing, pushing me towards an inevitable demise – at least death promises an end to this suffering.

Today I revealed my truth to him – how my job drives me towards suicidal thoughts as tears clouded my vision and choked back words of agony – yet his response was merely disappointment. When he asked about discussing it with his supervisor, guilt restrained me from becoming an added inconvenience, so I declined - but deep down, it's glaringly clear how much I needed his support today and was met with indifference instead. My mother’s concern only extends to my shortcomings; she fails to grasp the depths of my depression or suicidal contemplations unless they affect my employment status.

{"prompt":"Why am I burdened with such a wretched existence while my peers seem to lead charmed lives? And naturally, I can't seek solace in discussing it because I anticipate being met by someone spouting off dismissive victim-blaming rhetoric, insisting that I simply need to work harder, despite my earnest efforts. My quality of life is abysmal primarily due to circumstances beyond my control. For many, life represents nothing but a relentless curse, while for a privileged few, it unfolds like paradise. We find ourselves toiling longer and harder each day only to receive dwindling returns, all to feed the insatiable greed of billionaires. Back in the '50s-'70s, even a factory worker enjoyed a higher standard of living than a young professional does today. As a man, I struggle to find love and face criticism for daring to have standards – all I seek is fairness (and no, physical appearance is not what I refer to); I simply desire an equitable connection. While women are courted with evaluations and offers, men are expected to shoulder the majority of the effort (equality at its finest \/s). Throughout my life, I've endured bullying, harassment, and consistent mistreatment. My parents refuse to accept me for who I am as I've strayed from the stringent beliefs in which I was raised; unfortunately, lacking a supportive partner compounds this dilemma. Additionally, there are numerous other grievances with them. Living within South Asian Muslim culture – even in Western society – presents its own set of challenges. Despite my hardships and lack of resources, any attempt on my part to voice grievances is met with attacks and victim-blaming; it seems there are individuals out there who take pleasure in kicking me when I'm already down. It's become evident to me that luck plays an overwhelmingly significant role in 99% of one's life experiences. While diligence and additional efforts can yield slight improvements at best, luck stands as the fundamental determinant of our paths in life.

{"prompt":"Why did I end up with such a difficult life in contrast to those around me? It's frustrating that I can't even seek solace for fear of encountering judgmental individuals who subscribe to the belief that victims are at fault and just need to work harder, despite already putting in my best effort. My struggles largely stem from circumstances beyond my control. Life seems like an endless struggle for many, while others appear to effortlessly dwell in paradise. The current societal landscape demands longer hours of labor with diminishing returns, all to cater to the insatiable greed of the wealthy elite. The living standards of a factory worker in the mid-20th century surpassed those of a young professional today. As a man, finding love proves to be challenging, and expressing preferences is often met with criticism – all I seek is a fair partnership, devoid of superficial expectations (and no, physical appearance is not my focus). Women seem to receive attention and choices effortlessly, while men bear the burden of initiating everything (oh the joys of equality, right?). Throughout my life, I've endured bullying, harassment, and consistent mistreatment. My parents fail to accept me for who I am due to our conflicting beliefs rooted in a rigid upbringing; without a supportive partner by my side, escaping this environment seems impossible. Cultural norms within South Asian Muslim communities pose additional challenges even when living in Western societies. Expressing my grievances only leads to further scrutiny, blame-shifting, and perhaps even callous reactions from indifferent individuals waiting to kick me when I'm already down. It feels like 99% of one's life is governed by luck – a truth I've come to accept. While hard work may yield some incremental changes, luck remains the underlying determinant of one's journey through life.

{"prompt":"It feels like everything is falling apart for me. I grew up in a family where I felt unwanted by my mother, pushed too hard by my father, distant from my brother, and even faced verbal abuse from my sister, who once encouraged me to end my own life because she believed no one cared about me. I have always felt like I wasn't the daughter or sibling they deserved. While my relationship with my father has improved over time, I can't shake the feeling that he deserves better than a flawed and messed-up daughter like me. The emotional and mental torment inflicted on me within my family has left me feeling broken and like I'm losing my mind. To add to the pain, I experienced trauma as a child through sexual abuse.\n\nI have been burdened with multiple diagnoses from mental health professionals, describing it as a mix of various disorders that weigh heavily on me. As a coping mechanism, I isolated myself and immersed in playing videogames, trying to escape from a world that seemed full of hatred towards me. One misguided interaction with someone online further feeds into my self-loathing and belief that I am beyond redemption.\n\nI am haunted by an incident where, under the influence of alcohol, I made inappropriate comments to someone online who turned out to be underage. Although nothing illicit happened between us and we were merely joking around as friends, the realization of my error has left me tormented by self-doubt and self-criticism.\n\nThe weight of my mistakes, coupled with feelings of inadequacy and alienation from society due to difficulties in socializing with people my own age as pointed out by my doctor – who also noted delays in my mental development – is suffocating me with depression and self-loathing.\n\nI feel like a failure in every sense – a disgrace not only to society but also to my own family. The desperation for an escape from this agony has led me down dark thoughts of ending it all through suicide. Despite previous unsuccessful attempts at taking my own life, I am now resolved to make a final effort and ensure success this time around. I have begun preparations for what seems like an inevitable end after this weekend.\n\nI apologize profusely for the pain and burden I believe myself to be causing everyone around me.

I never lived up to their expectations and have struggled with being a disappointment to them. While my relationship with my father has improved now, I still believe he deserves a better daughter than someone as messed up as me. My family's emotional and mental torment has taken a toll on me, along with the childhood trauma of being sexually abused. I have been diagnosed with various mental disorders that leave me feeling overwhelmed and disconnected from the world around me. Escaping into video games has been my coping mechanism to avoid the hostility I feel from society. \n\nRecently, an incident occurred online where I interacted with someone younger who misrepresented their age. Under the influence of alcohol, I made inappropriate comments which I deeply regret and have since apologized for extensively. The situation made me question myself and spiraled into self-loathing, wondering if I am a terrible person at my core. Despite my flaws and poor decisions, including struggling to form connections with people my age due to feeling out of place socially, I am not a predator or someone who seeks relationships with minors.\n\nFeeling like a failure in every aspect of my life has led me to contemplate ending it all. I am consumed by depression and self-hatred, convinced that society would be better off without me. The idea of suicide has crossed my mind before, but previous attempts failed.

My family dynamics have been far from ideal - a mother who never seemed to want me, a father who was overly critical, a brother uninterested in me, and a sister who would tell me hurtful things.

While I have managed to establish a good relationship with my father, I still can't shake the feeling that he deserves someone better than me – someone less messed up. The emotional and mental turmoil I've faced within my family has left me feeling broken and isolated.\n\nGrowing up, I experienced trauma that continues to haunt me. A medical professional once described my condition as having \"a little bit of everything syndrome\" due to the multitude of disorders I've been diagnosed with. To cope, I turned to videogames as an escape from a world that seemed to reject me at every turn. \n\nA regrettable incident occurred while interacting with someone online, where in a moment of poor judgment under the influence of alcohol, I made inappropriate comments to someone much younger than they initially claimed to be. Despite my profuse apologies and clarifications that my intentions were not malevolent, the guilt and shame have consumed me. The fear of being perceived as something I am not – a monster – weighs heavily on my mind.\n\nI acknowledge that my past mistakes have compounded into overwhelming self-loathing and feelings of inadequacy. My struggles with forming relationships with individuals my age stem from difficulties in understanding social norms and belonging within society. My therapist has highlighted that my cognitive development lags behind, leaving me feeling out of sync with others my age.\n\nThe burden of depression coupled with intense self-hatred has become unbearable. The thoughts of being unwanted and unworthy persist, leading me to contemplate drastic measures for escape. Despite failed attempts in the past, the urge to end this cycle of pain feels stronger now.\n\nI offer this message as an apology to the world for simply existing as a flawed individual who struggles with proper conduct due to mental health challenges. The weight of societal expectations and familial disappointment further drive me towards thoughts of self-erasure.\n\nI know ending it all seems like the only solution left – a way out from this suffocating despair. I plan on taking definitive action soon as an end to this enduring torment. Please understand that this decision stems from deep-rooted anguish rather than seeking attention or causing harm.\n\nI express profound regret for any hurt caused by my actions or words throughout this journey fraught with mistakes and missteps. This decision is not made lightly but stems from a place of immense suffering that seems insurmountable.\n\nAs much as it pains me to accept, I believe my presence is more burdensome than beneficial, hence why bidding farewell seems like the most merciful choice for all involved parties – including myself.\n\nI thank you for taking the time to read these words; they serve as an attempt at closure amidst all-encompassing darkness where hope feels scarce and redemption distant.\n ->","completion":" be"}

{"prompt":"At the young age of 14, my sole reason for staying alive is my younger brother. These last two years since I returned to Romania, I've been weighed down by an overwhelming amount of stress primarily stemming from school in 2019. Back then, I found myself lacking friends, often crying myself to sleep each week; even activities that once brought joy became dull. The idea of ending my life crossed my mind numerous times, but the thought of my precious little brother always held me back. He means everything to me and is the sole force keeping me going. Amidst the pandemic, things slightly improved as although anxiety still plagued me, I found solace in a supportive friend who was there to lend an ear and offer valuable assistance.\n\nHowever, as of late, everything has taken a turn for the worse. The burden of stress and anxiety is crushing me; I lack motivation for anything. Moreover, last year I came to terms with being atheistic and bisexual. Given my family's deep religious beliefs and the same held by my circle of friends, this revelation has added another layer of complexity to my struggles. Recently opening up to my only friend about this resulted in him growing distant – he was the one person with whom I felt secure enough to confide in and share regular conversations.\n\nMy emotions are bottled up inside me because I fear that if I express them to anyone close to me, they will likely dismiss it as a passing phase or simply attribute it to youthful naïveté saying ‘you're just a kid; what do you have to be stressed about?’ As schools gear up for reopening following online learning, with teachers anticipated to be particularly stringent due to the circumstances, I find myself on edge.

Perhaps you are battling depression, feeling like your skills are not valued by others enough to provide you with a sense of purpose, and maybe you are not particularly religious. You might catch yourself fantasizing about how things would be different if you were in a romantic relationship. Your relationship with your parents may have been strained or overly intense, leaving you feeling unloved or suffocated. You might have considered turning to substances like drugs or alcohol to numb the stress. However, deep down inside, even though suicidal thoughts cross your mind, they could just be a way to cope – a means of escaping into a fleeting fantasy rather than taking real action. Rest assured that you likely won't go through with it; acknowledge that the fear holds you back and understand that even contemplating suicide requires more courage and resolve than actually going through with it. It's common for people to harbor self-loathing, and even those who appear confident may struggle internally – maintaining a facade as a way of avoiding confronting their true selves.\n\nShould you change your mind and decide to pursue such extreme actions, don't do it passively.

Battling with depression, it seems like you lack skills that others would find valuable for you to derive a sense of purpose; most likely, you're not particularly religious. Perhaps you catch yourself fantasizing about how having a significant other could change things. Maybe your relationship with your parents was strained or overly suffocating.

However, the actual fear of taking such extreme steps reveals that even thoughts of suicide serve as a coping mechanism - another way to divert your mind from reality and remain stuck in inaction. Deep down, you're afraid of the notion itself; even contemplating suicide requires a level of courage and resolve that seems more daunting than the act itself. It's common for people to harbor self-loathing, and those who claim otherwise are likely just masking their insecurities to avoid self-reflection. In the event that you reconsider your decision and feel determined to go through with it, there's no need to do so quietly. If you decide to make a statement, do so boldly and flamboyantly.

{"prompt":"I have been battling with my suicidal thoughts for what feels like an eternity, and today, I find myself at a breaking point. There was never a specific trigger for my depression or these thoughts of ending it all; they have simply lingered within me for as long as I can remember. Over the years, I have diligently followed prescribed medication regimens, sought help from therapists, maintained an active and healthy lifestyle, easily formed friendships, and consistently pushed myself to try new things in the hopes of discovering a purpose that resonates with me. Despite many aspects of my life going well, my struggles with suicidal thoughts have repeatedly caused me to derail or even make attempts on my own life, effectively overshadowing everything else. Initially frightening, this existential battle has now left me feeling indifferent and hollow towards life in general. The feeling of depersonalization accompanying these thoughts has intensified over the past couple of years, leaving me increasingly devoid of any motivation or desire to continue living.\n\nDespite my ability to navigate relationships both platonically and romantically and perform well at work, nothing seems rewarding enough to justify the effort it demands. I find myself at a loss; overwhelmed by the burden of existence and grappling with a profound emptiness that pervades every aspect of my being. The idea of putting an end to this suffering becomes more appealing by the day, despite knowing deep down that it is not the right path. The constant struggle to find joy in anything has been a recurring theme in my life, making suicide seem like the only viable option.\n\nCurrently residing under someone else's roof following a recent hospitalization and facing impending bills without the financial means to settle them adds further strain to an already unbearable situation. The prospect of enduring excruciating pain during another suicide attempt is terrifying but seems like the only remaining option. Thoughts about procuring a firearm solely serve as motivation for attending a job interview at a dismal workplace known for its unfavorable conditions.\n\nThe pervasive sense of depersonalization has distanced me from any potential sources of hope or positivity in life. Interactions with others feel burdensome, setting goals appears futile as they only contribute to stress rather than fulfillment, and every task seems overshadowed by the looming question – \"why bother when I could end it all?\". Although depression has been a lifelong companion, this newfound sense of detachment has eradicated any sense of purpose or desire that once propelled me forward.\n\nNavigating out of a long-term relationship and walking away from employment situations have left me stagnant; immobilized by fear not of death itself but rather the potential suffering involved in achieving it through traditional means. Financial constraints further confine me in this state of hopelessness, preventing access to alternative methods while also hindering progress toward stability or self-improvement activities.\n\nA sense of entrapment pervades my existence as I grapple with indecision about how to move forward when every path seems laden with insurmountable obstacles... ->","completion":" at"}
{"prompt":"I've been grappling with suicidal thoughts for what feels like an eternity, and today, I find myself at a breaking point. There hasn't been a specific trigger for my depression or suicidal tendencies; they've just lingered for a long time. Despite following medication routines, seeking help from counselors, staying active and healthy, easily forming friendships, and consistently putting myself out there to explore new avenues in search of purpose, my life has had its successes. However, my struggle with suicidal thoughts has often derailed me, causing things to fall apart or leading me to make attempts on my own life. This pervasive aspect of who I am used to terrify me, but now I feel completely apathetic and hollow towards it and everything else in life. I lack the energy to pretend to be normal or engage with others, no longer experience emotions, view my once-beloved hobbies as burdensome chores, and struggle to envision any desires for the future.\n\nThis sense of detachment from reality linked to my suicidal thoughts has persisted for a couple of years now, amplifying my inability to find a reason or will to continue living. My perpetual misery clouds any hope for change despite knowing deep down that this isn't right. At this juncture, feeling this way has become almost ingrained in me; it's all-consuming. While I manage to maintain decency at work and in relationships—both platonic and romantic—it all seems futile. I'm currently facing a profound emptiness that leaves me indifferent towards existence itself.\n\nLiving under someone else's roof after a recent hospitalization episode has only exacerbated these feelings of hopelessness. The idea of enduring and seeking solace in the \"it gets better\" mantra feels increasingly unattainable as time progresses—life seems to be spiraling downwards relentlessly. Financial obligations loom ahead without the means to meet them; hence, the thought of ending everything starts creeping in as a viable option. The fear of enduring excruciating pain during another attempt reinforces these thoughts.\n\nThe upcoming job interview presents itself as a conflicting motivator—a necessary step towards acquiring the means for another attempt while harboring uncertainties about survival through it. The prospect of entering a bleak work environment with dire conditions is juxtaposed against the potential financial gain it offers—a transactional necessity rather than an anticipatory endeavor.\n\nDepersonalization has made suicide seem like the only plausible course of action left for me; it's an isolating predicament where numbness prevails over any semblance of emotional connection or ambition. Formerly enjoyable interactions have now become burdensome chores, while setting goals feels like unnecessary stress exacerbating an already overwhelming situation. The pervasive thought pattern remains centered on questioning the utility of any effort when compared against the finality that suicide promises.\n\nThe longevity of depression combined with this newfound depersonalization has stripped away any sense of purpose or desire within me. Exiting a long-term relationship, abandoning employment opportunities—all culminating in stagnation and inertia—reflects the depths of despair within which I reside currently. The fear of potential pain from self-harm techniques serves as an ironic deterrent against actions contemplated due to financial constraints further limiting options.\n\nThe entrapment within this cyclical struggle underscores feelings of being trapped without clear pathways forward amidst financial hardship intensifying the pervasive sense of being stuck in an unending loop devoid of solutions or escape routes. ->","completion":" at"}

{"prompt":"I am engulfed in an indescribable agony that inexplicably feels like my rightful place. It seems as though pain is my designated spot in this world. I find myself coveting the normalcy of others, which breeds a simmering resentment and disdain towards anyone who diminishes my humanity. I perceive myself as subhuman, utterly devoid of worth or capability – a mere failure at every turn. If I were ignorant, perhaps things wouldn't affect me so deeply. Sometimes I contemplate the bliss of complete ignorance, where the complexities of the world elude me entirely, allowing joy in simple pleasures. However, it doesn't mean I desire ignorance; after all, who would?\n\nSimilarly, while I envy everyone around me, I do not yearn to be like them. It's as though this pain has intertwined itself with my very being, a comfort I am hesitant to relinquish. The thought of enduring even more suffering crosses my mind – to be scorned by all as a wretched outcast and perpetual disappointment. In the solitude of nighttime, a profound sense of isolation engulfs me; however, paradoxically, I shun human contact as vehemently as I detest everyone else. Embracing fear seems natural; these negative emotions are mine to bear. The idea of experiencing excruciating pain consumes me – an unending craving for torment surrounds me.\n\nThe notion of hope eludes me entirely. While others have had pillars of support in various forms – family members, friends, partners, mentors – I have always navigated through life solitary and desolate. Devoid of friendships and bereft of parental affection from the outset have left me hollow and unfulfilled. Witnessing the simple joys that others experience only serves to deepen my despair further. Reckoning with the reality that certain life experiences will forever remain beyond my reach compounds my sense of worthlessness.\n\nI often find solace in consuming junk food but remain acutely aware that it's become a destructive coping mechanism akin to drug abuse. My self-loathing intensifies with each passing day as I indulge in this vicious cycle repetitively despite harboring no real appetite for sustenance. The looming shadow of financial instability adds yet another layer to my distress; any mention of physical discomfort is met with dismissive mockery from those closest to me.\n\nMoreover, feeling dejected due to my weight impedes any motivation for self-improvement – caught in a cycle where financial constraints and personal insecurities reinforce each other relentlessly. The prospect of breaking free from this suffocating pattern seems insurmountable; well-meaning advice urging a change in perspective or pursuit of alternative paths feels hollow against the backdrop of my despair.\n\nIn essence, the burden upon me is relentless and overwhelming; even the legendary strength of Hercules would falter under its weight – a truth that isn't lost on me.' ->","completion":" in"}
{"prompt":"I am experiencing unbearable pain that strangely feels like it belongs to me. I find myself believing that pain is my rightful place in the world. I harbor envy towards those considered normal, which only fuels my resentment and hatred towards anyone who diminishes my worth as a human being. In my eyes, I feel subhuman, truly believing I am worthless and inept at everything except for failing. Strangely, being ignorant might not trouble me much. At times, I ponder the appeal of being blissfully unaware, to the extent of not comprehending the complexities of the world - finding joy in simple things. However, this does not mean I wish to be unintelligent; naturally, nobody would desire that.\n\nSimilarly, though I yearn to be like others, deep down, I resist transforming into someone else entirely. It's as if this pain has become an intrinsic part of who I am, and a part of me doesn't wish for it to dissipate. There's a peculiar desire within me to endure even more suffering - to be scorned by all as a failure and an outcast. Amidst the solitude of night, a profound sense of loneliness grips me like the last living person on Earth - a thought that frightens me yet keeps me from seeking solace in others due to my disdain for humanity. It's almost as if it's acceptable to feel fear; perhaps it's necessary even. Every negative emotion should engulf me; every sensation should feel like needles and blood.\n\nRegarding my current situation - well, hope was never present for me anyway. While others had a support system in various forms such as family members, friends, partners or mentors - some form of surrogate family - throughout my life's journey, I have remained utterly alone and continue to do so. The absence of friendships and love from my parents has been a constant source of torment for me. Witnessing others bask in happiness only serves to magnify my inner turmoil. One can only experience childhood once; mine was marred by isolation and neglect leaving a void within me so deep that it feels as if those years never truly existed for me - as though I were born anew yesterday with no skills or successes to speak of.\n\nEngulfed by an addiction not to substances like smoke or alcohol but rather junk food – one might argue that individuals fail to recognize its crippling hold over one’s life because it isn't viewed through the same lens as conventional addictions are perceived.\nI wallow in self-hatred while lying motionless in bed staring at the unyielding ceiling day after day – consumed by thoughts about my weight and inadequacy – repeating incessantly how much I detest myself.\n\nIn addition to these tumultuous internal battles lies another cause for concern: an ongoing health issue with symptoms manifesting around my tailbone known as pilonidal sinus disease.\nAs if this physical pain weren’t enough, financial worries now plague my mind relentlessly adding another layer of distress.\n\nBeing overweight and lethargic further exacerbates my melancholy rendering even breathing an arduous task during bouts of depression.\nThe vicious cycle repeats itself: feeling useless perpetuates feelings of financial instability leading back to feelings of inadequacy thus reinforcing self-loathing.\n\nThe interactions ahead loom ominously with anticipated advice on overcoming obstacles accompanied by encouragements pertaining adopting a different mindset or embarking on alternative paths—all well-intentioned but divorced from understanding what it’s truly like grappling with such issues firsthand.\nAt present moment, every option appears bleak and insurmountable; even Hercules himself would falter under such immense emotional weight – something beyond my capacity to bear alone.' ->","completion":" in"}

{"prompt":"This situation feels incredibly overwhelming. I wish I could convey everything verbally rather than writing it down, to truly convey the depth of my emotions. My family persists in believing that my desire to end things is solely due to my past with my ex-partner, when in reality, it's this insufferable inner turmoil that's consuming me. It's agonizing beyond words, and I can't comprehend why I'm going through this. I understand that my ex doesn't truly care about me, evident in the hurtful things she did behind my back. Maybe she strategically wanted me to stumble upon that explicit video someday – who knows? Although I'm enraged and feel like lashing out, I can't entirely blame her either. Discovering that my husband had disturbing inclinations towards minors and cross-dressing added another level of complexity to an already turbulent situation; she did what she did before knowing this about him. It took her months to decide to leave after those revelations surfaced. While I can empathize with common relationship woes, this goes beyond a fractured partnership – it delves into the deep-seated struggles I've carried long before meeting her. As a fundamentally good person, I recognize the wrongness of it all and have earnestly attempted to curb these issues, yet they persist and worsen despite my efforts. Moreover, it's disheartening that my family attributes everything to my failed marriage without acknowledging the underlying issues. Even after leaving a detailed note explaining my actions, their reluctance to confront the truth exacerbates the situation instead of offering support as needed. The avoidant approach isn't alleviating anything – it's only compounding the pain. ->","completion":" in"}
{"prompt":"Feeling overwhelmed. It's becoming unbearable. I wish I could express everything verbally instead of writing it down, so they could hear the depth of my emotions in my voice. My family is still holding onto the belief that my desire to end things stems solely from issues with my ex-partner. But it's not just about that – this internal struggle is consuming me, and it's excruciatingly painful. I can't comprehend why all of this is happening to me. Despite understanding that my ex doesn't value me and the deceitful actions she took while we were together, including that disturbing video I stumbled upon - maybe she intended for me to discover it one day. While I'm furious and feel like lashing out, I can't entirely blame her either. The revelation about my ex-husband's unsettling preferences for underage content and cross-dressing was a shock, even though she engaged in these actions before our relationship deteriorated. I realize such betrayals happen to many couples, but this issue goes beyond just the aftermath of my failed relationship; it delves into a lingering personal battle predating our connection. It's draining because deep down, I know it's morally wrong. Despite my relentless efforts to overcome it, the struggle persists and worsens over time. To add to the burden, my family refuses to acknowledge this deeper issue and keeps attributing everything to my past relationship woes. I left a detailed note outlining why I've reached this decision, yet even then, my mother chose not to disclose the full truth to my brother. This avoidance and dismissal of reality need to stop – it only adds to the complexity of this already agonizing situation! ->","completion":" in"}

Yet, being alone plunges me into deep despair. I detest the solitude but can't bear burdening my friends with my emotional turmoil. It's like being imprisoned within my own mind, unable to break free from this suffocating feeling. It truly sucks.\n\nI just want all this suffering to end. Why can't I simply find happiness? Oddly, even commercials trigger my depression. The sounds, music, voices, and the crescendo at the end of commercials get to me. Perhaps it stems from some childhood memory, but pinpointing the exact trigger eludes me. Being compelled to exist in a life I never chose is overwhelming.\n\nLast night was my first attempt at sober sleep in three months and it only made me contemplate suicide further. My thoughts are relentless, preventing any restful sleep. This agony is unbearable. If a higher power exists, I have a few inquiries for that entity before any potential damnation.\n\nThe insensitivity of people adds to the distress – especially when they ask if I'm okay only to talk over me as soon as I begin sharing my feelings, diverting the conversation back to themselves instead. People can be so self-absorbed.\n\nI often wonder if contemplating suicide brings me some relief because once I devise a method that seems foolproof, a strange sense of tranquility washes over me momentarily – a reprieve from the relentless darkness clouding my mind.\n\nCan medication truly alleviate depression? The idea crosses my mind but I fear becoming numb and devoid of emotions, merely existing without truly living. This world has lost its appeal to me.\n\nWhat is the value of life that everyone talks about preserving it so vehemently? The pressure to succeed and build a future for oneself feels meaningless when we're destined to depart from it all eventually. Despite constant advice on how to live life meaningfully, it all seems futile and purposeless to me.\n\nAt 29, attempting a genuine relationship for the first time ended in heartbreak for me as she left for other partners despite our shared plans and life together – including her children whom I cared for deeply as my own since I have none of my own.\n\nOpening up about suicidal thoughts only led to dismissive reactions urging hotline calls or therapy sessions rather than genuine conversations or support from those around me - even supposed friends seemed unavailable emotionally in my time of need.\n\nThe disillusionment with this world and life itself grows deeper within me; opting out seems more appealing than continuing this bleak existence until old age strips away autonomy entirely – an impulsive decision may soon replace meticulous planning; the farewell letter stands ready for that inevitable moment. ->","completion":" id"}

It's like being trapped in my own mind, unable to escape. I just wish this emotional turmoil would end and that I could find happiness.

My mind is racing non-stop, making sleep impossible. It's a miserable experience. If there is a higher power, I have a lot of questions for them before any eternal damnation.\n\nIt's disheartening when people ask if I'm okay but then fail to listen as they redirect the conversation towards themselves. It makes me lose faith in human decency. Is it strange that thinking about suicide momentarily lifts my spirits after devising what seems like a foolproof plan? I've been contemplating seeking medication for my depression but worry about becoming emotionally numb and lifeless.\n\nI've lost interest in life lately. The concept of valuing life and working hard towards success only to ultimately die and leave everything behind seems futile to me. At 29, I attempted a serious relationship for the first time, investing emotionally and materially, only to be abandoned by my partner for others despite our shared plans and deep connection.\n\nFeeling utterly betrayed and abandoned by those closest to me has left me disillusioned with this world. The lack of support or genuine understanding from supposed friends pushes me further towards the edge of despair. Despite reaching out for help, only to be met with generic advice like calling a hotline or seeing a therapist instead of receiving real compassion or empathy exacerbates my sense of hopelessness.\n\nThe thought of ending my life has become increasingly persistent, though I remain uncertain about when or how it will happen.

It's excruciating, man.\n\nI yearn for all this agony to cease. Why is happiness such an elusive state? Oddly enough, commercials trigger a wave of desolation within me. Perhaps it stems from my past, but identifying the exact trigger eludes me. Being coerced into a life I never chose is crushing. Tonight marks the first sober attempt at sleep in three months; the urge to end it all grows stronger. My mind races incessantly, depriving me of rest. It's unbearable. If a higher power exists, I have some pointed questions before any final judgments are made.\n\nThe hollow inquiry \"Are you okay?\" echoes hollow when met with incessant self-absorption during attempted confessions. People can be so frustrating sometimes. Is it peculiar that envisioning suicide momentarily lifts my spirits and lessens the despair? Can medication truly alleviate depression? Contemplating it raises uncertainties; becoming an emotionless shell isn't appealing either.\n\nThis world doesn't hold much appeal for me anymore; the disillusionment runs deep within my core. Why do people attach such value to life? The pressure to achieve success and construct a future seems futile when faced with mortality. At 29 years old, diving into my first genuine relationship seemed promising until it crumbled before my eyes.\n\nThe intensity of emotional investment was met with betrayal as she pursued other partners while we had jointly built a life intertwined with her children too - whom I cared for as my own in absence of progeny of mine own. Despite promises of enduring commitment through adversity, she callously pushed me away when things got tough.\n\nNavigating trust in this era is treacherous terrain rife with uncertainty and disappointment; even heartfelt disclosures of suicidal thoughts were met with callous indifference from those around me who deflected responsibility onto hotlines or therapy sessions instead of genuine empathy or conversation.\n\nThe desolation is overwhelming and the desire to opt out grows stronger by the day - old age where I'm dependent holds no allure over embracing finality sooner rather than later.\nWriting this brings some solace amidst the turmoil; while the specifics remain uncertain, the inevitability of an impulsive act looms over solitary nights like a shadow.Preliminary preparations have been made in silent anticipation.\" ->","completion":" id"}

I am so accustomed to them that I can endure the pain as I patiently wait for the blood loss to take its course.\n\nInitially, I had considered throwing myself in front of a train, but traffic is scarce right now. Waiting until summer or for the quarantine to lift would delay my plans, and time is not on my side.\n\nWhy am I resorting to this drastic measure? Simply put, because the emotional anguish has become unbearable. I despise my reactions to life's events, loathe the workings of my mind, and detest the immense pain these factors subject me to.\n\nEvery instance you spend time with someone else triggers a panic attack in me. My assumptions and doubts about your feelings for me intensify these attacks even more. The constant bickering between my parents, mounting work pressures, compounded by my own anxieties and thoughts, all culminate in overwhelming panic attacks.\n\nI am disgusted by the fact that I cannot allow you a normal existence or be a positive influence in your life. These issues are escalating rapidly – can you fathom what lies ahead?

Hearing him talk about almost dropping out if not for those connections leaves me at a loss for words. While I struggle through each day in solitude, he effortlessly attracts others, especially girls, initiating conversations without effort. Being around him is disheartening as I feel like a failure in college for the second time. The constant dread and anxiety are overwhelming - mornings serve as painful reminders of the academic obligations I dread facing. Despite having had a relatively normal yet solitary childhood with a caring family who still tends to my daily needs, I feel disconnected from them, drowning in sheer frustration rather than affection. Motivation eludes me; even activities I enjoy like writing stories or reading books lose their appeal quickly, leaving me feeling aimless and unproductive.

The habit of self-harm has been a long-standing coping mechanism for me, starting off small but now leaving scars that cover my entire body. It's been my way of converting emotional pain into something physical. The feeling of emptiness has plagued me since I was just 12 years old.

I find it hard to connect with others, often lying and causing harm without any rationale.

I find myself unable to maintain eye contact with my girlfriend, let alone muster the courage to seek assistance. It just dawned on me that I haven't truly looked at myself in years because facing the person in the mirror is unbearable. Sure, I've glanced at my outward appearance or acknowledged changes like new hairstyles or outfits, but delving beneath the surface is terrifying.

Lately, my unsuccessful attempts to end everything have left me feeling even more defeated. It's gotten to a point where I can't even meet my girlfriend's eyes; seeking help from her feels like an impossible task. Looking at myself in the mirror has become unbearable. I've ignored who I am beneath the surface for so long. The image of strength that I've projected outwardly is masking the fact that I'm no longer that person. The fear of accepting this truth has isolated me further from everyone else. It's been four days since I last went to work; getting out of bed seems like an insurmountable challenge. My girlfriend probably thinks I resent her because expressing my death wish feels beyond words for me. My son, whom I lost custody of last year, must be wondering why his father is absent from his life now – but deep down, I doubt my ability to positively contribute to his upbringing. My colleagues are likely puzzled by my sudden disappearance without any explanation; it's probable that they've already given up on me - just like how I gave up on myself years ago.

As time progresses, your values are likely to evolve for the better, shedding light on what truly matters in life. Drawing from personal experience, it's worth noting that unless one has endured significant loss (purposefully left ambiguous given its diverse forms), there is a high likelihood of emerging from current struggles with time, eventually finding strength and pride in overcoming them. It is essential to maintain faith in yourself - demonstrate to life that you can withstand these challenges and persist. Remember to reevaluate your circumstances once you've navigated through them.\n\nIf you come from a background where one or both parents still love and support you, consider the immense anguish they would experience losing not just their own parents but also their child.

{"prompt":"I feel lost and overwhelmed. I'm grappling with constant suicidal thoughts. My depression is pushing my friends away, despite my attempts to confide in them. They question the legitimacy of my struggles because they don't see physical signs like cuts on my arms, not realizing that I bear scars on my knees instead. \n\nAt this moment, it's 3:07 am and suicide is weighing heavily on my mind. I've made two attempts in the past three weeks but halted them abruptly without a clear reason. Initially considering overdose, which seemed ineffective, now I am contemplating jumping off a 200ft bridge near my house, just an hour's bike ride away.\n\nThe weight of being a burden is crushing me as others distance themselves, fueled by bullying related to my ADHD and severe anxiety that often render me silent in their presence. Their hurtful words urge me to end my life as they mock previous attempts and label me as unintelligent.\n\nConcealing my feelings has become second nature over the last four years. The emotional pain has reached a breaking point where suicide appears as the only escape from this agony. Recollections of the abuse inflicted by my narcissistic father haunt me even after fleeing his grasp four years ago; his desire for control scarred me mentally and physically since I was just an 8-year-old child.\n\nDespite knowing that at 15, there could be a future ahead of me, envisioning it feels impossible due to the overwhelming despair clouding my judgment. While I have or had a therapist, reaching out for help feels futile as thoughts of self-harm consume me entirely, ruling out any possibility of seeking aid from a school counselor.\n\nI yearn for nothing more than release from this unbearable pain that eclipses any semblance of hope or joy in life. My mother stands as a beacon of love and support amid this darkness, but even her unwavering care struggles to penetrate the depths of despair that have enveloped me.\n\nThe ongoing lockdown in the UK intensifies these feelings of hopelessness and despair, amplifying the urge to make another attempt on my life soon.\n\nIn summary, I feel like a burden due to being taunted about mental health issues such as ADHD and anxiety, coupled with PTSD-induced trauma that fuels relentless bullying and push towards suicidal ideation.

It's all becoming too much, pushing me closer to the edge where ending my life feels like the only way out.

It's hard to shake off this profound sadness and feeling of inadequacy that defines who I am. The mere thought of someone peeking into the dismal reality of my existence fills me with an intense urge to end it all. The desire to escape this torment plagues my every thought. Sometimes, in moments of despair, I can't help but wonder why not redirect the attention from ruthless killers towards individuals like me who see no purpose in prolonging their suffering.

Happiness eludes me, and it seems like it will always remain out of reach. Despite having loved ones around me, I feel an overwhelming sense of insignificance, believing that they will carry on just fine without me.

Thoughts of suicide pervade my mind daily as living no longer holds any appeal; it's as if a part of me has already perished.\n\nI liken my current state to being submerged underwater, desperately gasping for air.

While I have the means to survive, I lack the desire to do so. Happiness eludes me, and the prospect of ever finding it seems bleak. Despite having loved ones around me, I can't shake the feeling that their lives would continue without a hiccup if I were no longer here. Although it might be tough on my mother, she has my other siblings for support. At just 18 years old, it already seems like everything is going downhill rapidly—I feel as though all my dreams have crumbled away under the weight of hopelessness. The thought of living feels suffocating; self-hatred consumes me without respite. This pervasive despair has left me contemplating thoughts of suicide daily; envisioning how it might unfold and how best to minimize the pain for those I leave behind has become an all-consuming preoccupation.\n\nThe notion of taking another breath feels akin to being trapped underwater with no way out. My abhorrence towards myself remains unexplained as hopelessness continues to crush any semblance of joy or purpose within me. The possibility of ending it all becomes increasingly tempting as everything I once held dear—my dreams, hopes, zest for life—lie in ruins before me. Each passing day brings me closer to accepting this bleak fate where there seems to be no reason left worth fighting for.\n\nI find myself at a crossroads where indifference towards my own well-being blurs the line between passive self-destruction and suicide. Troubled by potential lung issues stemming from vaping yet unable to muster the motivation to address them due to an overwhelming sense of apathy towards life itself raises unsettling questions about where I stand mentally and spiritually.\n\nRecent revelations have dashed my aspirations of becoming a private investigator—a dream that was deeply interwoven with my sense of purpose and identity at 18 years old—rendering it unattainable due to a single mistake involving marijuana.

Despite trying various avenues for help, nothing seems to make a difference. Dealing with people who claim that professional assistance works for everyone is exhausting. The reality is that it doesn't help me at all, and I find myself growing increasingly weary of this existence. There are moments when the fact that I am still a virgin overwhelms me with thoughts of despair and makes me contemplate ending it all. It's incredibly disheartening. Sharing these thoughts here is not easy for me as I often receive cliché advice that does little to alleviate my pain.\n\nThe underlying reason behind my perpetual state as a virgin and a loner lies in my profound chronic depression, which stifles my essence (This issue seems to be hereditary rather than a consequence of my virginity). It plunges me into a state where I feel emotionally dead, dull, and withdrawn. Additionally, I'm aware that I don't possess standout physical attractiveness. Suggestions like \"work on your personality\" or \"put yourself out there more\" fall flat because those offering them fail to grasp how depression has turned me into an undesirable individual. There are times when the emotional burden becomes unbearable, pushing me towards thoughts of self-harm. My disdain for life only intensifies as I struggle through meaningless workdays and return home consumed by depression, unable to find solace in anything.\n\nEvery aspect of life feels like imprisonment to me; the mere thought of engaging with the world drains any semblance of motivation from within me. The mundane routine of working tirelessly at a menial job further solidifies this feeling of entrapment. While some may find respite in the company of a loving partner at the end of each day, such solace eludes me entirely and seems like an unattainable dream. The only semblance of joy I find is in video games, yet even they fail to provide lasting fulfillment.\n\nExpressing how utterly debilitating depression can be is quite surreal; it pervades every facet of my being until life loses all meaning (removed). If only more individuals could engage openly in discussions about suicide without fear or judgment... The weight of severe depression coupled with anhedonia leaves me devoid of ambition or hope for a better future.\n\nLife appears utterly pointless under the heavy cloud cast by depression; even activities that used to bring some solace like gaming quickly lose their appeal now (removed). The idea that trying new things could offer any respite from this pervasive darkness feels almost insulting given the depth of despair that defines my existence.\n ->","completion":" id"}

Due to COVID restrictions, I took care of their new kittens alone for a few weeks before reuniting with them during a permitted visit. Because of this, the kittens have grown quite fond of me.

Due to COVID guidelines, I had been solely caring for their new kittens for a few weeks before being able to reunite with my parents (within our support bubble). Consequently, the kittens have grown quite attached to me. I had set aside a week for this visit (even taking time off work) with the expectation that my parents would want to spend quality time together amidst the presence of the kittens. However, they showed no interest in bonding with the kittens and instead became envious and irritated when they sought out my company.

The thought of ending everything when I turn 21 persists in my mind relentlessly, despite any personal desires against it - these words are merely an expression of a fleeting thought or perhaps a subconscious search for solace amid this turmoil. I feel trapped in a perpetual state of emotional numbness and lack the ability to assert myself or make choices autonomously - constantly relying on external cues for direction. At times, shedding tears brings temporary relief amidst the emotional desolation that engulfs me nightly, leaving me feeling like an abandoned child resigned to perpetual sorrow and solitude.\nThe weight of academic inadequacy compounds my despair as dropping out is not an option given the ramifications it would have on my future and the heightened disappointment it would bring upon my already disillusioned parents.\nThe fear that any potential improvement or discovery of love may come too late, leaving unfulfilled potentials in its wake weighs heavily on my soul.\nIt often seems that people only recognize the depths of your struggles when you are no longer capable of voicing them yourself - a reality that adds another layer of unbearable heaviness to the burden I already carry.\nThe overwhelming sense of hopelessness has become unbearable; every moment feels like an insurmountable challenge pushing me closer towards the edge than ever before - the burden feels too heavy for one soul alone to bear.\n\n ->","completion":" be"}
{"prompt":"I am on the verge of being removed from a class by my teacher due to lack of participation just because I am struggling with a frustrating app. I attempted to seek assistance from her, but being in an online class makes it challenging to explain the issue thoroughly; I would prefer face-to-face guidance. Online schooling is something I deeply despise. My parents are already greatly disappointed in me, viewing me as weak, lethargic, quiet, and a failure, and this potential expulsion could be the final straw. The looming possibility of being scolded and labeled as lazy or worse is overwhelming. I am exerting effort to prevent being dropped from the class; however, I am already a week behind and had to withdraw from another course due to stress. It's frustrating that my anhedonia and apathy issues render me passive about the situation. I feel like I am losing touch with myself – unable to think clearly or make decisions without external input. It seems like there's something fundamentally wrong with me, but articulating it proves challenging. The idea of seeking a straightforward diagnosis from a doctor is appealing because self-explanation escapes me. There's a deep sense of not feeling fully present within myself. How can I rediscover who I truly am? This internal struggle of feeling mentally paralyzed is disheartening. Emotionally, crying has become somewhat cathartic amidst this mental turmoil. Do others also struggle with this mental fog? There's an underlying feeling that things are not right, yet expressing it remains elusive – especially when battling severe depression as an introverted individual typecast as the 'quiet kid'. Each night is spent in tears with a heavy heart and an unexplainable sense of yearning or perhaps lifelong passivity and apathy have dulled my capabilities? Falling so far behind academically intensifies feelings of inadequacy and stupidity complicating any notions of dropping out as it would jeopardize my future and invite further disappointment from my parents. The fear that any potential improvement or love will arrive too late hangs heavily in my mind - a missed opportunity for what could have been achieved lives within that thought. It feels discouraging that sometimes one only receives acknowledgment of needing help when they are no longer around; this crushing weight feels insurmountable at times - it all feels like too much to bear. ->","completion":" be"}

This friend and I have known each other for 14 years since we connected online, and our bond deepened significantly after meeting in person last year. I have battled with suicidal thoughts on and off due to my struggles with Crohn's Disease, stress, anxiety, and depression. Currently, I am in a better place mentally and have not experienced suicidal ideation for several months, a positive change for me considering a serious attempt I made back in 2009 that nearly cost me my life. \n\nMy friend has been grappling with chronic depression, severe anxiety, neuropathic pain, and spine disc degeneration for most of his life. Despite trying numerous medications, therapies, consultations with psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists, nothing seems to have brought him significant relief. The recent years have been especially challenging for him, leading him to contemplate ending his own life in the near future; he may act on this decision imminently.\n\nHe is married to a partner of 18 years who tends to be somewhat controlling though not abusive - just highly anxious. I want to support my friend in any way possible - whether through listening to him, offering advice or distractions, helping him devise coping strategies for each day, or sharing my own experience of struggling with suicide where my hesitation and regrets ultimately prevented me from going through with it.\n\nI am hesitant about involving his partner as it might escalate the situation given their dynamic. Additionally, he had a distressing experience being briefly hospitalized for severe sleep issues and would not want to put him through another traumatic event like that again.

I have battled with suicidal thoughts on and off due to my struggle with Crohn's Disease, persistent stress, anxiety, and depression. Presently, I find myself in a relatively stable place with no recent thoughts of suicide – a stark contrast to my serious attempt in 2009 that nearly ended my life. On the other hand, my friend has been grappling with chronic depression, severe anxiety, neuropathic pain, and degeneration of his spine for an extended period. Despite experimenting with numerous medications, therapies, consultations with mental health professionals like psychiatrists and psychologists over the years, there has been no significant improvement in his condition.\n\nRecent times have hit him exceptionally hard, pushing him to the edge where he seems to have made up his mind about ending his life imminently; it could be a matter of days. He has been married for 18 years; however, I am uncertain about how best to support him. I am willing to offer my presence in any way he requires – to lend an ear, provide advice, brainstorm coping strategies for each day, and share insights from my own struggle with suicidal thoughts (where hesitation and remorse saved me from following through). Yet, I am hesitant to involve his partner who tends to be somewhat controlling (though not abusively so – just high-strung), fearing that it could escalate the situation further. Moreover, recalling how traumatic a brief stay in a psychiatric ward was for him previously due to severe sleep disturbances makes me apprehensive about repeating such an experience.\n\nHe seems to be waiting for some sort of miraculous intervention or a sign from the universe to give him purpose or direction.

This incident led to a discussion among our friends where some callously laughed and labeled me an attention-seeker, suggesting that my girlfriend should find someone else less prone to seeking sympathy. Those words cut deep, leaving me sobbing myself to sleep in her embrace for days on end.\n \nIn the midst of sharing her distress with a friend, he callously declared, 'I'm sure she's lying about cutting herself; she's just putting on a show - she's a fake cutter,' while others in the conversation shamefully encouraged my girlfriend to harm herself.

A few months back, when I was feeling hollow and numb inside, I seized the opportunity of my girlfriend being out for a walk to try and ease some of that pain. Upon her return, she stumbled upon the sight of my arm and was understandably shaken. During a subsequent discussion with our friends in person, some of them callously laughed and told my girlfriend, \"Why are you with someone seeking attention? She's more privileged than most people; you should leave her and find someone who isn't just pretending to cut for attention.\" These hurtful words drove me to tears for several nights as I sought solace in her embrace.\n\nIn a conversation where K (my girlfriend) confided in a friend about the situation, hoping for support, she was met with disbelief instead. The friend boldly declared, \"I'm sure she's lying, she didn't actually cut herself; she's pretending. She's just faking being a cutter.\" This conversation took an even darker turn as others in the chat proceeded to goad K into harming herself.

Currently, I'm on a work placement, but once this six-month period ends, I am lost as to what to do next with my life. I feel inadequate in skills required and the necessity for job references is disheartening. The pressure to constantly excel at work overwhelms me; despite repeated attempts, I struggle to meet expectations. Even attending a job interview feels like an insurmountable task. The relentless cycle of feeling unworthy in job roles is draining me, and the financial strain exacerbates the situation. The high cost of living and the complexities of housing arrangements in the UK weigh heavily on me. I find myself easily moved to tears, unable to assert myself when faced with unfair treatment which seems all too common for me. The mere thought of preparing for work fills me with dread; trapped in this competitive environment, suicide seems like the only escape route. While other issues linger, my primary concern is managing financially as my perceived shortcomings hinder my prospects for employment. Feeling intellectually inadequate with no prospects for positive endorsements adds to my distress. My lack of initiative coupled with a poor memory hampers any enthusiasm for pursuing new interests or opportunities.

After an attempted suicide on Monday, my days were filled with online school and agonizing pain while feeling constantly unwell physically and mentally. To add insult to injury, I also had to deal with a pounding headache. Surprisingly, amidst coping with the aftermath of a failed suicide attempt, physical distress, ongoing depression, and the desire to end it all, the toughest challenge seemed to be school. Despite my sincere efforts, the burden of having to immediately resume classes after a suicide attempt or even facing two attempts within two weeks revolving mostly around school makes it unbearable. The fact that this struggle is what weighs heaviest on me is disheartening.\n\nThe past three days since Monday have felt like an eternity. My sole motivation was to make it through until Friday, with hopes of no more punishments on the horizon so I could finally access my delayed birthday presents and indulge in activities that bring me joy again. Being isolated during punishment for weeks without being able to connect with friends has been excruciating. It felt like being left alone with suicidal thoughts but having no outlet or distraction because apparently allowing some happiness in my life is out of the question.\n\nI have come to believe that I do not deserve joy but instead only deserve death due to this continuous cycle of punishment and suffering. The resounding message I receive is crystal clear - I am unworthy of happiness.\n\nThe extension of my punishment for another week following my suicide attempt serves as a stark reminder that even after giving my best effort or facing life-threatening situations, it is never sufficient. Every struggle, every consequence pushes me closer towards the edge - making every further attempt seem inevitable.\n\nWell, today I took significantly more pills than before hoping for an uncertain outcome – maybe this time it will be different? The prospect of death offers solace as it releases me from all other worries.\n\nEarlier on, I convinced myself that today wouldn't be the day I end my life. However, now I am uncertain about that decision.

{"prompt":"I'm at my breaking point. There's no one I feel comfortable turning to, and the effort it takes to stifle my tears is overwhelming. My eyes ache from sleepless nights. Even engaging in activities I once loved feels impossible. Today, when I made an attempt to step outside, guilt consumed me for simply trying to prioritize my well-being. Exhaustion has become my constant companion. While harming myself isn't a consideration, the weight of these distressing thoughts is suffocating, and I'm gripped by fear. ->","completion":" in"}
{"prompt":"I'm struggling and feeling like everything is too much to handle. I feel like I continuously let people down and weigh them down with my issues. I'm reaching a point where I can't cope anymore. This is hard to articulate, and I don't know where to turn. The idea of ending things is on my mind, but I fear the pain that might come with it. What should I do? I just want the suffering to end. ->","completion":" id"}
{"prompt":"I'm really struggling right now. To be honest, I feel like everything is getting too much for me to handle. I constantly feel like a letdown and a source of trouble for those around me, and I can't see a way out. I apologize for the jumbled nature of this post; I'm feeling lost and confused. It's hard to reach out to anyone about this. The idea of ending things crosses my mind, but the fear of it being a painful process holds me back. Can anyone offer guidance on how to make this all go away? ->","completion":" id"}
{"prompt":"I am in desperate need of assistance. I’ll be honest: living feels increasingly pointless to me. The relentless chaos unfolding around me is just too much to endure. It seems that I only bring about disappointment and burdens for those around me, and I’m yearning for an escape. Apologies for the scattered nature of this message; my thoughts are jumbled. Opening up to someone is currently beyond my capacity. The idea of ending my own life haunts me, despite my longing for peace. How should I navigate this situation? My ultimate wish is for all this torment to cease. ->","completion":" id"}
{"prompt":"I survived an overdose. I vividly recall my mother's voice in my head telling me that it's impossible to end one's life with ibuprofen, during a conversation about taking it to a concert or someone she knew (although I can't quite recall the details at this point). I feel foolish because her words echo in my mind, making me question my actions. Despite ingesting over 120 pills of ibuprofen and drinking hard liquor straight from the bottle, in retrospect, my overdose feels like a senseless and inexplicable act. Why is it that I struggle to grasp the severity of the situation? Why can't my mind acknowledge the fact that I was on the brink of death? Even though deep down I may have desired it, I refused medical help for as long as possible. I have no recollection of agreeing to seek treatment, but according to my boyfriend, I consented. Obviously, at that time, I was in no state to give any sort of consent. As I continue to process everything, I still find it strange to label it as an overdose. These thoughts frequently resurface unexpectedly, leaving me conflicted about sharing them with my boyfriend as he is ->","completion":" at"}

{"prompt":"I find myself caught in a spiral of self-loathing. Although I am new to this platform, I feel compelled to share my struggles. At 30 years old, I am a single father to a soon-to-be 8-year-old son. Financially, I can manage to pay my bills, but it's a constant struggle. The journey with depression predates his birth, and the betrayal and abandonment by his mother four years ago only amplified my pain. While not clinically diagnosed, I recognize the signs – viewing life through a pessimistic lens and lacking the will to go on.\n\nGrowing older, thoughts of leaving this world have become more familiar. I intend to persevere until my son reaches adulthood, but the weight of despair feels overwhelming. Despite my efforts, I can't seem to align the pieces of my life. My aspirations remain unattainable due to my diverse work background. Rejection from potential partners due to my physical appearance adds another layer of disappointment.\n\nI find myself at a crossroads where success seems unattainable; feeling like a perpetual failure has taken its toll on me. The lack of motivation reinforces my belief that I am insignificant and merely taking up space in this existence. While thoughts of suicide linger, the thought of abandoning my son holds me back, though the idea resurfaces as he approaches independence in eleven years.\n\nThe burden of being viewed as an unsuccessful and inadequate father by those around me weighs heavily on my conscience. Questioning my purpose in life while enduring constant suffering leaves me at a loss for how to cope with this relentless pain and feeling of inadequacy. ->","completion":" id"}
{"prompt":"Expressing deep-rooted self-loathing feelings. I'm newly joined here, but drowning in self-disdain. I, a 30-year-old single dad to a soon-to-be 8-year-old boy, can just about meet our financial needs, ensuring food and shelter. However, I've battled with depression long before his birth. The betrayal and abandonment by his mom four years back only aggravated it. While not officially diagnosed, I harbor a bleak outlook on life and see no reason to continue. The thought of departing grows more appealing with age, though I'll wait until my son is grown. Yet, pulling my life together seems beyond reach. My career aspirations remain out of grasp due to my experience mismatch across various fields. Rejected by women due to my \"dad bod,\" I feel trapped in an endless cycle of failure and lack of progress. Efforts have been made, yet every attempt reinforces my sense of worthlessness and futility. Existing feels like an unbearable burden; suicidal notions linger yet lack the courage to act upon them - not while my son depends on me for support for at least another eleven years. Still, he's left with a father incapable of success, leading to probable disgrace for him. Coping with life's relentless anguish seems insurmountable as I perceive myself failing those closest to me - my son, parents, and all who know me. Questions of purpose plague me; am I merely meant to endure suffering without end? ->","completion":" id"}
{"prompt":"I tend to go on about my self-loathing, but here's the thing. I'm a 30-year-old single father to a soon-to-be 8-year-old son, barely managing to cover our bills while ensuring we have food and a roof over our heads. The truth is, I've been battling depression long before his arrival. The turmoil of his mother betraying me and leaving us in the lurch four years ago certainly compounded it. Though not clinically diagnosed, I believe my persistent pessimism and lack of will to live are clear indicators. As time passes, thoughts of departing this world grow more enticing. Naturally, I'll wait until he's of age, but the overwhelming sense of failure and inability to get my act together persist.\n\nMy aspirations remain out of reach due to my lack of experience in relevant fields; potential romantic interests are put off by what they perceive as a \"dad bod.\" I feel trapped in a cycle of disappointment, devoid of any meaningful accomplishments. Despite feeble attempts at improvement, I can't shake the feeling that I'm simply taking up space. Life seems like an insurmountable challenge. While I'm reluctant to admit it outright, thoughts of suicide linger at the edges of my mind. However, my son deserves better than that fate for his father.\n\nThe countdown ticks away—eleven more years until he's grown—and then maybe I could entertain those dark thoughts. For now, all he sees is a father who can't seem to catch a break, possibly ashamed of the man he calls Dad. How does one endure such agony in this existence? The weight of disappointment towards my son, my parents, and everyone else weighs heavily on me. What purpose do I serve by persisting if only to suffer? ->","completion":" id"}
{"prompt":"I've been reflecting on my self-loathing tendencies. I'm new here and I find myself grappling with a persistent issue. As a 30-year-old single father to a soon-to-be 8-year-old son, I manage to scrape by with paying the bills, although it's a constant struggle. Even prior to his birth, I battled with depression. The betrayal of his mother, who cheated on me and walked out on us four years ago, only exacerbated my struggles. While I haven't received a formal diagnosis from a healthcare professional, I recognize the signs in myself – always viewing the glass as half empty and lacking the will to carry on living. With each passing year, the notion of exiting this existence becomes increasingly appealing. Naturally, I intend to wait until my son reaches adulthood before making any decisions in that regard. Nonetheless, I find myself unable to piece my life together cohesively. Every career path that piques my interest appears out of reach due to my mismatched skill set. Women seem uninterested in me due to what they brand as a \"dad bod.\" It feels like I'm stuck in a cycle of relentless failure, devoid of any success or progress. Despite attempts at mustering some motivation, I can't shake off this overwhelming sense of worthlessness. The burden of navigating through life weighs far too heavily on me. While I refrain from explicitly labeling myself as suicidal because I lack the courage to act upon it – mainly driven by the responsibility towards my son – the thought lingers at the back of my mind for when he comes of age in eleven years. As it stands now, he's left with a father who sees himself as unsuccessful and projects his shame onto him. How does one cope with such profound anguish? I grapple with feelings of inadequacy towards my son, parents, and those in my social sphere alike.

{"prompt":"I'm finding it hard to continue. The tasks of cooking, cleaning, and self-care have become overwhelming burdens, leaving me with little motivation beyond earning money to cover my bills and enjoying occasional moments with friends. There was a time when I had ambitions and believed that this state of mind would never engulf me. However, attempts at creating art recently only left me feeling empty and fatigued when the results fell short. Creating used to bring me joy. I reveled in the process of experimenting and dedicating time because it held value for me. Yet, the influences of capitalism and the need for instant gratification have deeply affected my mental well-being. This wasn't how things were supposed to unfold for me, yet here I am. Uncertainty clouds my thoughts about my direction and the potential futures that lie ahead. Clarity eludes me completely now. I cling to a hope that this phase will pass soon, but the possibility lingers that it may not. Such is part of life too. Is it acceptable to settle into a corporate job that brings contentment while leading a mundane existence? It weighs on me heavily knowing that my predecessors endured so much for me to grapple constantly with thoughts of self-harm and despair. At times, I wonder if it would have been better had I never existed at all. ->","completion":" id"}
{"prompt":"I've reached a point where everything feels overwhelming. The thought of cooking, cleaning, or even looking after myself just drains me. My main drive now is to earn enough to pay bills and occasionally meet my friends. There once was passion and ambition inside me, a belief that I was immune to feeling like this. Yet, whenever I attempted some art recently, it only left me feeling empty and discouraged. Creating used to bring me joy; experimenting with ideas felt worthwhile, not wasteful. However, the influence of capitalism and the need for instant gratification has twisted my mindset beyond repair. I never thought I would reach this breaking point. Uncertainty clouds my vision regarding where I'm headed or if any future awaits me at all. The confusion is all-encompassing - a constant struggle. Perhaps one day things will brighten up, or perhaps they won't; such is the unpredictability of life. Can one really find contentment in a mundane corporate job and settle for a mediocre existence? It feels like generations before me fought for my existence solely so I could grapple with thoughts of suicide and despair on an endless loop. Some days it makes me wonder if nonexistence would have been kinder to me in the grand scheme of things. ->","completion":" id"}
